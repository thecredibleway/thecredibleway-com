# Why are There so Many Hypocrites in Churches?

It's one of the most common criticisms leveled at Christianity - *"The church is full of hypocrites"*. And to be blunt,
there's truth in that. So the big question's - why? And what does that say about people, about faith and about God?

Let's start with an honest reality check.

## Under Pressure, Saints Snap

A well-known saying goes, *"Under pressure, saints snap"*. The other remainder of that quote is more
uncomfortable, *"Under pressure, saints snap and sinners strike; both held in check - one by faith, the 
other by fear of consequence"*. Every person - Christian or not - is a sinner by nature
([Rom 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A23&version=NKJV)) - that is reality.
Church membership doesn't magically remove human flaws. Quite the opposite - it simply reveals them.

Thomas Jefferson very carefully used the phrase *"pursuit of happiness"* when describing our inalienable rights. But
over time, this idea has been distorted - sadly even in the church. Happiness is now treated like a divine entitlement,
a thing to be chased through wealth, relationships, comfort or even religious activities. Advertisers preach it.
Churches sometimes do too. Jesus didn't call people to follow Him because He offered a better version of their lives.
He didn't say, *"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst after happiness."* He said, *"Blessed are those who hunger and
thirst after righteousness, for they will be filled"*
([Matt 5:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%205%3A6&version=NKJV)). If someone comes to Christianity
looking for personal happiness alone, they will be disappointed - and perhaps tempted to fake faith for social
or emotional benefits. 

Temptation, trials, and suffering often bring the truth of a person's character to the surface. Scripture exhorts us to
*"examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith"*
([2 Cor 13:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%2013%3A5&version=NKJV)). And life provides
ample opportunity for that test - How do we react when we don't get what we want? Do we walk by the Spirit or in the
flesh? Do we react in faith or in frustration? God never promised happiness in this life. God looks at our hearts and motives.
He promised righteousness to those
who believe ([Rom 3:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=roma%203%3A22&version=NKJV)) and eternal joy to
those who endure ([James 1:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james%201%3A12&version=NKJV)). In 
[Hebrews 11:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=heb%2011%3A25&version=NKJV), we read of Moses choosing 
*"to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin."*

## Weeds vs. Wheat - Hypocrisy and the Genuine Article

At its core, hypocrisy is not just lying to others - ***it's lying to yourself***. 
The biblical accounts serve as a sobering reminder that human fallibility has always been a factor
within the church. The church is not an exclusive club for perfected saints; rather, it is a hospital for saved
sinners - a group of humans who are, by definition, not perfect and in need of grace. The Bible teaches that
while believers are declared righteous by God through faith in Christ (justification), they are also
undergoing a process of becoming more like Christ (sanctification). This process is rarely linear and involves
setbacks, struggles and failures. They have to learn to renew their minds with the Word of God and then choose to die to the
flesh and live by the Spirit - this process takes time. The expectation that every Christian will immediately
and perfectly embody Christ's character is unrealistic and misunderstands the nature of spiritual growth.

It is also essential to distinguish between a struggle and a lifestyle. Every Christian will
stumble and fall. The Bible acknowledges this inherent human weakness and the struggle with sin
([Rom 7:15-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%207%3A15-25&version=NKJV)). A person who
genuinely repents after a moral failing and seeks to align their life with Christ is not a hypocrite.
Someone who deliberately and consistently lives a double life, professing one thing while
consciously practicing another without remorse, *is* a hypocrite. The Christian faith is not about achievement, but about
a direction of life, a turning towards God and a dependence on His grace for transformation.
We have been given [grace to overcome sin](../../jesus/because-he-lives/grace-and-empowerment.md).

Another sad truth is that sometimes people remain in church, not because they've surrendered
to Christ, but because it provides community, status or comfort. They mistakenly believe they can 
serve both God and the world - sit in church on Sunday and live for self the rest of the week.
Jesus himself warned about those who would *call* Him *"Lord, Lord"* *but not do the will of His Father*
([Matt 7:21-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207%3A21-23&version=NKJV)). The parable of
the weeds among the wheat
([Matt 13:24-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2013%3A24-30&version=NKJV))
illustrates this point perfectly - both true believers (wheat) and false professors (weeds) will coexist
within the visible church until the final judgment. These *weeds* may adopt the language and outward
appearance of faith, but their hearts remain unconverted and their lives reveal a fundamental disconnect
from the transformative power of the Gospel. Their actions are not a reflection of the Christ they claim
to follow, but rather a reflection of their unregenerate hearts operating under a veneer of religiosity.
Therefore, though their actions may be attributed to "the church," are not representative of genuine
Christianity. **It should also be noted that the hypocrisy of such individuals, while tragic, does not
invalidate the truth of Jesus Christ; any more than a counterfeit banknote invalidates genuine currency.**

**Saying "I don't go to church because of hypocrites" is like saying "I don't go to the gym because of
out of shape people."**

The church is a hospital for saved sinners, not a showroom for saints. **But it should also be a place of growth and transformation, not stagnation.**

We strive to be like Jesus Christ, He is our example, not people in the church. They may lead us along the way, but the 
standard is always Jesus Christ [1 Peter 2:21-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%202%3A21-25&version=NKJV).

It is also really important to emphasize that despite the presence of hypocrites, the church also contains
countless genuine believers who are sincerely striving to live out their faith, often quietly and
sacrificially. For every prominent example of hypocrisy, there are multitudes of Christians demonstrating
genuine love, compassion, integrity and service in their communities and around the world. These acts of authentic
faith often go unnoticed or uncelebrated, but they are a testament to the transformative power of the Gospel.
We wouldn't have missionaries or real humanitarian aid today if it were not for the likes of these genuine
people. **Take for example Mother Teresa, Heidi Baker, William Willberforce, Frederick Douglass, John Wycliffe
and many many more - where would the world be today without the genuine followers of Christ?**

The existence of counterfeits does not negate the existence or value of the genuine article.

## Confronting Hypocrisy with God's Truth

Even King David, a man after God's own heart, stumbled into deep hypocrisy when he pursued happiness in his affair
with Bathsheba and tried to cover it up. When the prophet Nathan confronted him, he didn't offer sentimental words
about David's feelings or a better life plan. He spoke directly about sin, righteousness and judgment.
**And David repented because the truth was told in love.**

Likewise, when the apostle Paul preached to Governor Felix
([Acts 24:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2024%3A25&version=NKJV)), he reasoned about
*"righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment"*. Felix trembled - not because he was promised happiness, but
because he was confronted with truth.

That kind of preaching is rare today. Many try to reshape Jesus to fit the culture - as a life coach, a therapist
or a happiness guru. The truth however is that Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever
([Heb 13:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013%3A8&version=NKJV)) - regardless of culture,
creed, race or region. His message hasn't changed - repent, believe and live. We should preach the same thing if we
truly call ourselves Christians.

**Hypocrisy isn't just a personal flaw - it's a stumbling block for the unsaved**. When Christians lead double lives,
their witness is damaged and people outside the church see the contradiction clearly. **The world is watching always,
and hypocrisy doesn't fool them. More importantly, it also doesn't fool God.**

The first step to avoiding hypocrisy is self-examination and honesty. Ask the hard questions - Am
I walking in the Spirit? Do I hunger for righteousness or comfort? Am I doing the Bible or just reading it?
Is Jesus Lord over my decisions, time, finances and relationships or is He second? The next step is to pursue
integrity. Christians will sin and grow as they renew their minds to the Word of God; but
the mark of a true believer is repentance, not performance. The one who falls and gets up again in faith learning from
their mistakes is not a hypocrite, but a disciple. We are also called to walk in love but not stay silent at wrongdoing.
Like Nathan, we are called to confront sin - gently, humbly and truthfully. Not to shame others, but to lead them to life.

## Why Does God Allow Hypocrites in the Church?

In [Acts 5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%205&version=NKJV), Ananias and Sapphira dropped dead 
for their hypocrisy. Jesus said the wheat and the tares will grow together until the harvest
([Matt 13:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2013%3A30&version=NKJV)), meaning that there will
be hypocrites right until Jesus returns. God is also merciful and He gives people time to awaken and truly
repent ([2 Peter 3:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%203%3A9&version=NKJV)).

The key to remember is that judgment belongs to God alone. The same Jesus who warned against hypocrisy also said,
*"With the measure you use, it will be measured to you"* ([Matt 7:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%207%3A2&version=NKJV)).
Instead of obsessing over the hypocrisy of others, we are called to examine ourselves.

We will all give an account for our own lives - not someone else or what they did to us.

## So what's under your skin?

What happens when life scratches beneath the surface of your life? If you're a Christian, do you walk in the flesh
or in the Spirit? If you are not a Christian yet please do not let the failings of man, undermine the perfect character
of Jesus Christ or the inherent truth of His teachings. Jesus lived a life of impeccable integrity, without sin or hypocrisy. He is the standard, not members of the church.

Turn to God's Word not your own wisdom. The goal of the Christian life is not to pretend to be good - but to be transformed
by the righteousness of Christ. **And that means dying to self, daily.** Renew your mind with the Word of God daily and let 
God His work in your life.
