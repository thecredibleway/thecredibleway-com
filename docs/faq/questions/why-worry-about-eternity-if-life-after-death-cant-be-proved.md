# Why Worry About Eternity if Life After Death Can't be Proved?

In a world that thrives on tangible evidence and scientific verification, how can we reasonably talk
about eternity - something we cannot test in a lab or observe first-hand? Faith in eternal life isn't rooted
in blind optimism or wishful thinking, but in credible, historical, spiritual and existential truths. When
people ask whether we can *prove* life after death, we must first ask *what kind of proof they're expecting.*
Christianity offers evidence in the form of historical eyewitness testimony, personal transformation,
fulfilled prophecy, the radical claim of a resurrected Saviour and the profound implications of an empty tomb.

## Belief Without Seeing Isn't Blind

Many things we accept - love, morality, consciousness - cannot be placed under a microscope,
yet we know they are real because we experience their effects. Christianity doesn't ask for
blind faith, but a reasoned trust. Belief in eternity doesn't rest on scientific proof, but on the 
[credibility of Jesus Christ](../../jesus/who-is-jesus-christ.md#is-jesus-credible). 
You have to ask yourself honestly - if a man can be crucified, buried, put in a tomb,
supernaturally raised to life and be seen by more than 500 eye witnesses is that credible enough?
Muhammad, Buddha, Confucius, Joseph Smith etc were great leaders but they never rose from the dead.
They never loved you enough to suffer and die for your sins and sickness, nor did they pay the
price to restore your back to relationship with God - only Jesus Christ did! If Jesus is credible,
then what He said is also credible! I have to believe what He says. It is no longer about my
personal opinion. The resurrection of Jesus, the miracles He performed, the consistency
of eyewitness testimony, and the internal witness of the Holy Spirit all provide a
cumulative case for believing that death is not the end. 

:::tip[Eternity]

We are not eternal because we want to be; we are eternal because we were made to be.

**Where will you spend eternity?**

:::

In [John 14:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2014%3A19&version=NKJV),
when Jesus said, *"Because I live, you also will live"*, He wasn't offering empty comfort.
He was declaring the foundation of Christian hope. **We believe in eternity not because we
can prove it in a lab, but because the One who conquered death has promised it - and He has
never broken a promise yet!**

## Near-Death Experiences (NDEs)

Sceptics often ask *Can anything beyond religious texts suggest the possibility of life after
death?* While Scripture provides the most direct revelation, other avenues also support belief in eternity.
Thousands of cases have been documented where people have clinically died and later been revived,
often reporting remarkably consistent themes - heaven, hell, light, peace, awareness, or even
seeing deceased loved ones. While NDEs are not definitive proof of the afterlife, they point to
the fact that there is life after that - a reason for the soul. Some experiences have included accurate
descriptions of events or conversations that happened while the individual was clinically brain-dead.

For example [Bill Weise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYxKRoONrfY) who spent 23 minutes in hell, before
coming back. He recounts places in hell,
the darkness ([Mat 8:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%208%3A12&version=NKJV)), 
the torment ([Mat 25:41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%2025%3A41&version=NKJV)),
stench of sulphur and decay ([Rev 14:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev%2014%3A10&version=NKJV),
[Rev 21:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2021%3A8&version=NKJV)),
unimaginable thirst([Luke 16:23-24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016%3A23-24&version=NKJV))
and the complete lack of peace and rest ([Rev 14:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev%2014%3A11&version=NKJV)),
([Isa 38:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isa%2038%3A18&version=NKJV)) 
and an overwhelming sense of hopelessness - all of which match what the Bible's description of
hell is. 

[Howard Pittman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKnwGMG7PHg), died of an internal haemorrhage and went to
heaven and then returned to earth and has some remarkable things to say of what he saw of religion that is
common whereas what God wants relationship with us. Pittman's account emphasizes a stern rebuke from God,
who told him that his life and works, despite being a minister, were unacceptable much like a *Laodicean-type*
Christianity (referencing [Rev 3:14-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%203%3A14-22&version=NKJV),
signifying lukewarmness). A key part of his message is that a **vast majority (as high as 97%) of
"professing Christians" are not truly living for God and are, in fact, on a path to destruction, as lukewarm
believers.** He stresses **the need for genuine, Spirit-filled living and not just outward religious observance.**
He highlights **the reality of heaven, hell, eternity, angels and demons and what true Christianity needs to be.**

[Karl Falken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_eoadbIHBI), died of burns and learnt that the soul survives. He gives a
vivid description of his encounter of both heaven and hell, the reality of sin and eternity. A key part of his story
also resonates with Howard Pitmann's account in that only 2.5% people make it to heaven because of religion - people
need to have the right motives and need to be in a relationship with God!

In [The Case for Heaven, by Lee Strobel](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Heaven-Journalist-Investigates-Evidence/dp/0310259193),
the award-winning legal editor of the Chicago Tribune and a spiritual sceptic until 1981, he interviews experts
about the evidence for the afterlife. He gives near death experiences of many people including his own
where he was close to a coma - and after that he went searching for answers and found Jesus Christ.

There are several more like this, all that have too many things in common to be coincidences.

## Moral and Existential Realities

If there is no life after death, then what is the ultimate meaning of life, suffering
and justice? Without eternity, moral accountability collapses. If death ends everything,
then ultimate justice is never served. Many people throughout history have done terrible things
and died in comfort, while others have lived righteously and suffered unjustly. If there is no life
beyond this one, then moral accountability is ultimately meaningless.

But Christianity says otherwise. Eternal life is not just about reward - it's about restoration.
The brokenness of this world will one day be healed. The injustices made right. The tears wiped away.
As [Revelation 21:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021%3A4&version=NKJV)
declares, "He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or
crying or pain... ". **The character of God, as revealed in the Bible, aligns with a universe
that extends beyond the grave, where love and justice ultimately prevail.**

## Transformed Lives as Testimony

The evidence of eternity is not only in Scripture or argument, but in lives changed by the
reality of it. What could have motivated a small group of fishermen and ordinary people to
boldly proclaim a crucified messiah in the face of immense opposition, unless they had witnessed
something truly extraordinary? The rapid spread of Christianity throughout the Roman
Empire, despite severe persecution, suggests a powerful underlying conviction,
inexplicable by natural means alone. The [early Christians were not only willing to die for
their belief in eternal life](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-martyrs.md); they lived
sacrificially, generously, and courageously. Why? **Because they believed death was not the end.**

[**Publius Tacitus**](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md#tacitus-publius-cornelius-tacitus)
(56 - 120 AD), is widely regarded as one of Rome's greatest historians. He came from the wealthy
equestrian class and become a senator and consul. With Emperor Titus's favour, he accessed imperial
records and high-level sources, ensuring meticulous accuracy. His "Annals" notably references Jesus
during his account of Nero's persecution of early Christians, an authentic Roman record
untainted by later alterations.

:::info[[The Annals 15:44, Tacitus](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Annals_(Tacitus)/Book_15#44)]

But all human efforts, all the lavish gifts of the emperor and the propitiations of the gods, did not
banish the sinister belief that the conflagration was the result of an order. Consequently, to get rid
of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for
their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had it's origin,
suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators,
Pontius Pilatus and a superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea,
the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part
of the world find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who
pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the
crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their
deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to
crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight
had expired. 

:::

To this day, countless believers of Christ find peace, courage, and even joy in the face of
death - not because they deny its reality, but because they know it is not final. As Paul wrote
in [2 Corinthians 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205%3A1&version=NKJV),
"For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God,
an eternal house in heaven... ". This peace is not the result of emotional denial - it flows
from a genuine relationship with the risen Christ. The change in how believers view life,
suffering, and death itself is evidence that they are living in the light of eternity.

## The Resurrection of Jesus Christ 

Perhaps the most pivotal of these is the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 
The word 'resurrection' isn't merely the existence into which someone might (or might not)
go immediately after death - it's the reversal of death! When the early Christians spoke
of Jesus being raised from the dead, it was literal - throughout the ancient world
something happened to Jesus that had never happened to anyone else! 
**These appearances were not just mystical visions - Jesus ate with people, spoke with
them and allowed them to touch His wounds.** 

The [crucifixion](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-crucifixion.mdx) and the
[resurrection](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md) and His subsequent appearance to
numerous individuals over a period of 40 days, testify of Jesus' divine nature and confirms
His victory over sin and death - hence the Apostle Paul clearly says that if Christ had not been raised
from the dead, then nothing else matters: no hope, no future, nothing! It is our sincere hope that each
of us comes to understand the profound sacrifice of Jesus Christ. God is real, He loves us and He desires
a relationship with every one of us!

:::tip[Truth]

Because Jesus Christ was resurrected, you and I have hope for today, tomorrow and all eternity! 

:::

The disciples, initially dejected and fearful, were utterly transformed by this experience.
Their willingness to [suffer persecution and even martyrdom](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-martyrs.md#what-happened-to-the-apostles) for their belief in the risen Christ is a powerful
testament to the conviction they held. The Apostle Paul, a former persecutor of Christians,
famously became a follower of Christ after an encounter with the resurrected Jesus. **His radical
change of life, from zealous opponent to fervent evangelist, is evidence for the reality of the resurrection.**

### Roman Historians

Let's say you dismiss the eyewitness accounts of the Jewish people, Jesus' followers, the New Testament,
and what your Christian friends say. **But can you really ignore what
[Roman](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md#roman-historians) and
[Syrian](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md#the-syrian---mara-bar-serapion) historians recorded?**
These weren't just ordinary men-they were legal experts and could think for themselves - Roman senators,
and provincial governors. **If anything, their testimony as hostile sources, is especially valuable and
considered the most credible since they had no reason to favour Jesus or His followers.**

The Romans were certainly no friends of Jesus Christ, or His followers - quite the opposite in fact!
They scourged Jesus, gave Him a crown of thorns, mocked Him, crucified Him and later persecuted
His followers the same way. And yet, their own historical records [acknowledge Jesus Christ, the early church,
and the surprising spread of Christianity].

**If the resurrection of Jesus from the dead was not real, why was the message of Jesus spreading rapidly?
Why were people willing to lose everything; be tortured and killed in such painful ways?**

:::tip[The simplest answer to everything]

Jesus Christ - the ultimate Occam's Razor!

:::

[**Flavius Josephus**](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md#flavius-josephus) (37 - 100 AD),
a respected Roman-Jewish historian, offers near-eyewitness quality in his writings. Contemporary with Jesus
and he offers insights into the era's cultural context. His major works, *Jewish Antiquities* and 
*The Wars of the Jews*, detail Hebrew history and the Roman destruction of Jerusalem, including the
fall of Masada in 73 AD. Josephus's access to Roman imperial resources, backed by Emperors
Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, allowed for detailed records beyond those of the Gospel writers.

:::info[[Antiquities of the Jews 18:63-64 - The accounts of Flavius Josephus about Jesus Christ](https://lexundria.com/j_aj/18.63-64/wst)]

[63] Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man; for he was a doer
of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many
of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. [64] And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the
principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not
forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these
and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are
not extinct at this day.

:::

There was also [Tacitus](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md#tacitus-publius-cornelius-tacitus),
[Suetonius](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md#suetonius-gaius-suetonius-tranquillus),
[Pliny the Younger](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md#pliny-the-younger-gaius-plinius-caecilius-secundus)
and the Syrian [Mara bar Serapion](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md#the-syrian---mara-bar-serapion)
who all recorded similar things regarding the spread of Christianity; which leads one to ask *if the
resurrection of Jesus from the dead was not real, why was the message of Jesus spreading rapidly?*


### The Empty Tomb

The empty tomb is a symbol of hope, transformation and new life. The coming of Jesus from heaven, His
crucifixion and His resurrection were [prophesied hundreds of years before His birth](../../jesus/crediblilty/prophecies-fulfilled.md).
This often gets overlooked as evidence, even though it provides crucial testimony of Jesus' resurrection.

:::info[The Empty Tomb]

The empty tomb was not opened to allow Jesus out - He was spirit and could walk through walls
([John 20:19-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020%3A19-26&version=NKJV))

It was opened so we could see in! 

:::

After Jesus' burial, Roman Governor Pontius Pilate sealed the tomb with a two-ton stone and
stationed a 'guards' (a 'guard' was a fighting unit of sixteen armed Roman soldiers), with
dereliction of duty by any man being punishable by death. Additionally, Jewish Temple guards
(240 Levites and 30 priests) patrolled the gates and courts nightly, facing severe penalties
for falling asleep. In fact, the Romans and Jewish priests did everything possible to prevent
Jesus' resurrection. Yet despite these precautions, an earthquake occurred; angels
descended and rolled the stone not just from the entrance but halfway up the mountain.
The terrified Roman guards
([Mat 28:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%2028%3A4%29&version=NKJV)),
facing death for any excuse (claiming a break-in, falling asleep,
or acknowledging a resurrection - which would be blasphemy), accepted a bribe from Jewish
priests. They falsely accused the disciples of stealing the body. 

This leaves one with even more questions:
1. How could twelve unarmed timid fishermen overpower numerous highly trained Roman
and Jewish guards? 
2. Why move a two-ton stone halfway up a mountain rather than just enough to remove a body?
3. Given the overwhelming security, how could the disciples do all this without alarming
even one person?
4. If they took the body of Jesus, where was it hidden and how was it the Romans did not look
for it to incriminate the Jews?

*It's simply not possible!*

:::info[Death could not hold Jesus Christ!]

Not only was Jesus not in the tomb, but He moved around the region, taught people publicly for 30 days
and there are over 500 eye witnesses accounts!

:::

### The Eyewitness Accounts

The Bible records several eye witness accounts of people seeing Jesus alive after His resurrection.
Some people claim these are fake because these aren't multiple individual written accounts. By that logic
though, all of ancient history would be unreliable given that most common people couldn't read, write
or document events - they were too poor to own things like this. The truth and reality though is that
all these people lived at the same time, so if there were contradictions they would be found out. 

These accounts were not just story or legend, they are truth - they demonstrate the reality of
Jesus' resurrection and His victory over death. That was the reason people were willing to be
tortured and crucified, rather than recant their faith. 
Even the Romans - who crucified Jesus - record His existence, death and resurrection.
His followers spread across the empire, refusing to renounce their faith despite torture and
execution. In Asia Minor and Rome, many were brutally killed or crucified, including being burned
alive or fed to animals. *If Jesus weren't real, what did they stand to gain by dying for Him?*

**Mary Magdalene**, witnessed the empty tomb and subsequently encountered the resurrected Jesus when she mistook
Him for the gardener ([Mark 16:9-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016%3A9-11&version=NKJV),
[John 20:11-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020%3A11-18&version=NKJV))
Several women, including those who were with Mary Magdalene, ([Mat 28:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%2028%3A9-10&version=NKJV)) seeing the resurrected Jesus.
**Two disciples on the Emmaus road** encountered Jesus recognized him as the Messiah, as He broke bread
with them ([Mark 16:12-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016%3A12-13&version=NKJV),
[Luke 24:13-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024%3A13-32&version=NKJV)).
**His disciples** - Jesus blessed His disciples before being taken up into heaven
([Acts 1:9-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201%3A9-11&version=NKJV),
[Luke 24:50-51](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024%3A50-51&version=NKJV)).
The apostle **Peter** was one of the first individuals to whom Jesus appeared after his resurrection
([Luke 24:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024%3A34&version=NKJV),
[1 Cor 15:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015%3A5&version=NKJV))
The **Apostle Paul** saw the resurrected Jesus
([1 Cor 15:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015%3A8&version=NKJV)), which radically
changed his life - he went from hating and persecuting followers of Christ; to becoming one himself - suffering
beatings, stoning, imprisonment and ultimately death for his faith. Why? *He met the resurrected
Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus!* Paul willingly gave up power, wealth and status as a
Roman citizen to follow Jesus Christ! He also strengthens Jesus's historical
credibility - naming Jesus's family, quoting Him, referencing the crucifixion,
burial, the last supper and meeting His disciples and brother James.
If Jesus wasn't real, why would His followers be active across the empire? Paul didn't gain
money or fame - only hardship and that in no small portion! The simplest explanation?
Jesus rose from the dead and Paul's life proved it.

Paul mentions in [1 Cor 15:3-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015%3A3-8&version=NKJV) that
Jesus appeared to **more than 500 people** at one time. There is also
[Acts 2:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202%3A32&version=NKJV),
[4:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%204%3A19-20&version=NKJV),
and [10:39-40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2010%3A39-40&version=NKJV)
There are multiple sources verifying the claim of 500 witnesses - documents from the apostolic period
by people outside the faith written to third parties (in this case Roman governors and Emperors, no less)

## Other Resurrection Accounts in the Bible

Jesus' resurrection is the cornerstone, there are several other accounts prefigure and
reinforce the hope of eternal life.

**Lazarus** - In [John 11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2011&version=NKJV). Jesus
waits four days before going to Lazarus' tomb. Why? *To show that death had done its full
work.* Lazarus wasn't merely unconscious or recently deceased - he had been buried for days.
Yet, Jesus calls him forth, and Lazarus walks out alive. Jesus proclaims before raising him,
*"I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die."*
([John 11:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2011%3A25&version=NKJV)). This event,
witnessed by many, was a powerful demonstration of Jesus' authority over life and death.

**The Widow of Zarephath’s son**
([1 Kings 17:17–24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2017%3A17%E2%80%9324&version=NKJV))
Raised through the prophet Elijah, showing God's power over mortality.

**The Shunammite woman's son**
([2 Kings 4:18–37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings%204%3A18%E2%80%9337&version=NKJV))
Raised by Elisha, again testifying to God’s care for individuals.

**The widow’s son at Nain**
([Luke 7:11–17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%207%3A11%E2%80%9317&version=NKJV))
Raised by Jesus in public view, moving the crowd to glorify God.

**Jairus daughter**
([Mark 5:35–43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%205%3A35%E2%80%9343&version=NKJV))
A young girl brought back to life by Christ’s word, witnessed by her parents and disciples.

Peter raised **Tabitha (Dorcas)** in [Acts 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=%5BActs%209&version=NKJV)
and Paul raised **Eutychus** in [Acts 20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=%5BActs%2020&version=NKJV).
These accounts, occurring within the context of the burgeoning early church, further
solidify the biblical claim of divine intervention in the face of death. They show that the
power demonstrated by Jesus was not limited to him alone but was also at work through his
apostles, signifying the continuation of God's redemptive plan.

Each instance speaks not only to God’s ability to defeat death, but His willingness to do so. They are not only acts
of compassion, but previews of what eternity holds for those who trust in Him.

**You have a choice and only you can decide what you want for your life and for eternity**. We really hope you
choose life! ([Deut 30:15-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2030%3A15-20&version=NKJV)).
Only Jesus can break the power of sin that we are born into, and [give you life](../../jesus/because-he-lives/i-can-face-tomorrow.md).
