# If a good God exists, why is there evil and suffering

The world doesn't merely appear chaotic; it is truly in disarray, with chaos evident in every aspect of life. We're
witnessing a proliferation of greed, driving horrific acts like murder, violence, wars, kidnappings, the rape of women
and the bullying of children. Corruption is rampant - permeating politics, law enforcement, big pharma, tech companies etc.
The human cost is immense - rampant sickness, broken marriages, terrified children, and an overwhelming sense of
loneliness and fear. We've just scratched the surface - leaving you wondering if God is in control or has He abandoned His
post at the helm? 

The question one of the the most difficult yet frequently asked of Christians. If God is good and all powerful, then why
does He allow evil, suffering and injustice in the world? For several people seeking explanations this is not merely a
philosophical problem, but a deeply personal one.

## The Origin of Evil - The Fall of Man

To understand why evil exists, we must go back to the beginning - specifically to the account of creation and the Fall of man
in Genesis. When God created the world, He declared it to be **very good**
([Gen 1:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A31&version=NKJV)). He created the Garden of Eden to be
Utopia - heaven on earth! There was no death, no suffering, no pain. Humanity, represented by Adam and Eve, lived in perfect
harmony with God and with creation.

But God did not create robots. **He gave humans the gift of free will - the capacity to love, obey, and trust Him or to rebel.**
This freedom was necessary for a genuine relationship, because love that is not freely given is not love at all.

When Adam and Eve chose to disobey God by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
([Gen 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203&version=NKJV)), sin entered the world. This one act of
rebellion, often called *the Fall*, brought catastrophic consequences - not only for humanity but for all of creation.
[Romans 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%205%3A12&version=NKJV) explains, "***through one man sin
entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned***"

:::info[The ripple effect of sin]

The Fall introduced a ripple effect - guilt, shame, spiritual separation from God, physical death, disease, decay
and moral corruption.

What had been a perfect world was now fractured. The human heart, once pure, was now inclined toward selfishness and sin.

:::

## The god of this world - Satan

In [2 Corinthians 4:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%204%3A4&version=NKJV), the
Apostle Paul refers to Satan as **the god of this world,** who blinds the minds of people. Although God is the Creator
of all things, Satan is the god of this world. This doesn't mean that Satan has ultimate authority, but rather that
he exercises significant influence over a fallen world system that is opposed to God. If people simply believed [the
gospel, would repent and acknowledge the need for a Saviour](../../jesus/because-he-lives/salvation-and-redemption.md)
and [trust Jesus Christ, they would not be in darkness](../../jesus/because-he-lives/i-can-face-tomorrow.md). Rather
they would know the truth and the truth would set them free.

When Adam and Eve sinned, they not only broke God's command - they effectively surrendered their delegated authority
over the earth to Satan([Luke 4:5-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%204%3A5-7&version=NKJV)).
The devil, once a high ranking angel who rebelled against God, now acts as the prince of the power of the air
([Eph 2:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%202%3A2&version=NKJV)), actively working
to deceive, destroy and oppose the purposes of God
([John 10:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2010%3A10&version=NKJV)).

:::tip[The real reason why evil is rampant]

The presence of evil in the world, then, is not a reflection of God's failure or impotence, but the result of humanity's
rebellion and Satan's influence. 

This fallen world is a battleground between the kingdom of darkness and the kingdom of God. 

**You have to pick which side you want to be on.**

:::

## So where is God in the midst of evil?

Though Satan has real influence and evil is undeniably present, the Bible is clear - God is still sovereign. He
has not abdicated His throne. He permits evil, but He is not the author of it
([Psa 103:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20103%3A19&version=NKJV),
[Rom 8:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208%3A28&version=NKJV)). 

:::info[I have free will to choose the course of my life]

God has a permissive will and a perfect will for all of us, but we choose which one (or none) to follow.

He desires to have a relationship and be one with us
[Romans 12:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012%3A2&version=NKJV) like the Garden of Eden,
but we have free will to choose what we do.

:::

God allows human beings to exercise free will, even when that will leads to suffering.

Yet even in the chaos, God's plan is never derailed. In fact, He offers one of the most profound responses- the cross.
God entered into our suffering through Jesus Christ. He did not stay distant - He experienced injustice, pain, betrayal
and death. ***He chose to suffer with us and for us, offering not a philosophical answer alone, but a personal one***.
The crucifixion of Jesus Christ was the greatest act of evil and injustice in human history - God in the flesh, perfect
and sinless, murdered by the very people He came to save. And yet, through this act, God brought salvation to the world.
Evil did its worst, but it could not thwart God's redemptive plan.

## The Hope of the Gospel

This brings us to the heart of the Christian message - the gospel (literally, *good news*). The world is broken,
sin is real, and suffering touches every life. But God has not abandoned His creation. In fact, He entered into it.
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to earth not merely as a teacher or moral example, but as the Savior.
He lived a perfect life, one we could never live. He died a sacrificial death on the cross, taking upon Himself the
punishment for sin. And He rose again, conquering death and offering eternal life to all who believe.

[Through Jesus, the power of sin is broken](../../jesus/because-he-lives/salvation-and-redemption.md), and
[the kingdom of God has broken into the present age](../../jesus/crediblilty/teachings-of-jesus.md#the-kingdom-of-god).
While evil still exists for now, its days are numbered. God promises that evil will not have the final word.
[Revelation 21:4-5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2021%3A4-5&version=NKJV) promises a future where
***"God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away."*** Until that day, believers are called to be salt and light
([Mat 5:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%205%3A13-14&version=NKJV)) - to push back against
evil, to love sacrificially, to proclaim the good news and to live as citizens of a different kingdom.


## Why Doesn't God End Evil Now?

The answer lies in God's mercy and patience.
[2 Peter 3:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%203%3A9&version=NKJV) explains,
***"The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, ... but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should
perish but that all should come to repentance."***

:::tip[A time of grace]

**God's delay is not indifference. It's grace.**

:::

If God were to eliminate all evil today, He would have to judge all sin - including ours. Let's not kid
ourselves, we have all sinned and fallen short. The only *good person* to have walked the earth is Jesus
Christ. But in His mercy, He waits, giving people time to [repent and receive salvation](../../jesus/because-he-lives/new-identity-in-christ.mdx).

**You have a choice and only you can decide what you want for your life and for eternity**. We really hope you
choose life! ([Deut 30:15-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2030%3A15-20&version=NKJV)).
Only Jesus can break the power of sin that we are born into, and [give you life](../../jesus/because-he-lives/i-can-face-tomorrow.md).
