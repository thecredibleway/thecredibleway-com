# Why are There so Many Types of Churches? 

If there's "one Lord, one faith, one baptism" ([Eph 4:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph%204%3A5&version=NKJV)),
why are there thousands of Christian denominations around the world? To the outside observer, it can seem confusing - even
hypocritical - for Christians who all claim to follow the same Bible to be so divided.

The number of denominations is a common stumbling block for sceptics and a source of genuine concern for many believers. But
understanding why these divisions exist - and what they do and don't mean can bring clarity and even deepen our
appreciation for God's work throughout church history. 

## The Foundation of the Church - Unity in Christ

The Bible is clear - the Church is meant to be united under Christ. *"There is one body and one Spirit... one Lord, one faith,
one baptism, one God and Father of all..."*. [Eph 4:4–6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph%204%3A4%E2%80%936&version=NKJV)
Jesus Himself prayed for His followers, *"that they may be one, as we are one"*
([John 17:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2017%3A22&version=NKJV)). The unity Christ desires is not
superficial but rooted in shared truth, mutual love and submission to God's Word.

Yet, from the earliest days, the church has faced disagreements - even among the apostles. In
[Acts 15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2015&version=NKJV), the early church held the Jerusalem Council
to settle a serious doctrinal issue about Gentile believers and the Law of Moses. Later, Paul confronted Peter publicly over
hypocrisy ([Gal 2:11-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%202%3A11-14&version=NKJV)). So even in the first
century, believers didn't always agree - and sometimes, sharp divisions occurred.

## Why Denominations Exist - A Mix of Factors

#### Doctrinal Differences

At the heart of many denominations are differences in interpreting Scripture. While all Christian denominations
generally agree on core doctrines - such as the divinity of Christ, the resurrection, salvation by grace and the
authority of Scripture - they often disagree on secondary  or non-essential matters. These differences, though
not central to salvation, are still meaningful and have shaped the identity and practices of various church traditions.

Common areas of disagreement include baptism - whether it should be administered to infants or reserved for
professing believers - as well as differing models of church governance, such as episcopal (bishops), presbyterian
(elders) or congregational structures. Christians also hold varied beliefs about the end times, including whether
Christ will return before or after a time of tribulation and how to interpret the millennial reign. Additionally,
there are debates over the role of spiritual gifts today, with some affirming their ongoing use (continuationism)
and others believing they ceased with the early church (cessationism).

:::info[Augustine on Christianity]

In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, love.

:::

While these theological differences have led to the formation of distinct groups or denominations, they do not
automatically determine someone's salvation or status as a true Christian. Rather, they reflect sincere attempts
by believers to be faithful to Scripture and to live out their convictions in community. 

#### Historical Events

The complex landscape of Christian denominations today can't be fully understood without looking at key turning
points in church history. One of the earliest and most significant was the Great Schism of 1054 AD, which divided
the unified Church into **Eastern Orthodoxy** and **Roman Catholicism**. This split was driven by theological and
political disagreements - most notably over papal authority, the filioque clause (concerning the Holy Spirit)
and cultural differences between East and West.

Centuries later, the **Protestant Reformation** in 1517 AD marked another major shift. Sparked by *Martin Luther's*
challenge to certain practices of the Roman Catholic Church - especially the sale of indulgences and the role
of Scripture over Church tradition - this movement gave rise to new expressions of faith such as **Lutheranism**
and the **Reformed** tradition. Over time, these movements multiplied into many Protestant branches, each emphasizing
different aspects of doctrine and practice.

The **Radical Reformation**, including groups like the **Anabaptists** and **Mennonites**, went further by
rejecting the union of church and state and advocating for believers baptism. Later, the **Wesleyan Revival**
in the 18th century emphasized personal holiness, discipleship and eventually gave birth to **Methodists**.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the emergence of **Pentecostal** and **charismatic movements** brought
renewed focus on the gifts and power of the Holy Spirit, including healing, prophecy and speaking in tongues.

:::tip[God uses imperfect people]

Despite the groups, throughout history, God has continued to work through imperfect people to preserve
and proclaim the gospel, reaching millions of people.

:::

Each of these movements contributed to the growing diversity of Christian denominations. Some emerged from
deep conviction and theological clarity, others as responses to corruption or imbalance, and still others
from unfortunate divisions fuelled by pride, politics or misunderstandings. 

#### Culture, Language and Geography

Different cultures often emphasize different aspects of the faith. Worship style, music, leadership structure
and community values vary. For example African churches often emphasize communal worship and spiritual warfare.
Eastern churches may emphasize mysticism and liturgy. Western evangelical churches may focus on personal 
salvation and Scripture study. What begins as cultural expression can develop into full denominational identity over time.

## Division Is Not Always a Sign of Disobedience

It's tempting to look at the existence of many denominations and assume failure. But not every division is sinful.

Sometimes division is necessary to preserve truth. Paul instructed believers to *"watch out for those who cause
divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned"*
([Rom 16:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%2016%3A17&version=NKJV)). If a church drifts into
heresy or moral compromise, it may be necessary to separate for the sake of the gospel.

Other times, division happens over secondary issues, not core doctrine. Paul and Barnabas parted ways over a
dispute about John Mark ([Acts 15:36–40](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2015%3A36%E2%80%9340&version=NKJV)),
yet both continued fruitful ministries. Their division wasn't ideal, but it didn't disqualify them from serving God
or producing fruit.

## Denominations Are Not the Same as Division in the Body

It's important to remember that **denominations are organizational, not spiritual**. The true Church is made up of all
who belong to Christ by faith - regardless of their denominational label. 

:::tip[The Bride of Christ]

Jesus is not coming back for Baptists, Methodists, Pentecostals or Anglicans. He's coming back for His bride, the Church
([Rev 19:7–9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2019%3A7%E2%80%939&version=NKJV)). And that Church is made
up of all who have repented and believed in the gospel
([Mark 1:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%201%3A15&version=NKJV)), no matter what their local church
affiliation is.

:::

There is a danger, though, in treating one denomination as superior or exclusive. Denominational pride or sectarianism
can lead to arrogance, tribalism or even false teaching. Paul rebuked the Corinthians for this mindset, *"One of you says,
'I follow Paul'; another, 'I follow Apollos'; another, 'I follow Cephas'; still another, 'I follow Christ.' Is Christ divided?"*
[1 Cor 1:12–13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%201%3A12%E2%80%9313&version=NKJV). At the end of the
day God will judge us based on the Bible and where our faith and motives lie.

## A Call to Biblical Unity, Not Uniformity

Unity does not require uniformity. God's kingdom is made up of *"every tribe and language and people and nation"* 
([Rev 5:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%205%3A9&version=NKJV)). The Church's diversity in worship,
culture and tradition can be beautiful - as long as it is submitted to God's Word and centred on the gospel.

As followers of Christ, we are called to uphold both truth and love in how we live and engage with others.
Scripture exhorts us to speak the truth in love
([Eph 4:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%204%3A15&version=NKJV)), reminding us that truth
is never to be wielded harshly or pridefully, but with compassion and humility. At the same time, we are to
bear with one another in patience ([Eph 4:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%204%3A2&version=NKJV)),
recognizing that unity in the body of Christ often requires grace, understanding
and perseverance, especially when we disagree.

While we are called to discern false teaching and guard sound doctrine, Paul warns us not to be drawn into
quarrels over minor or disputable matters ([2 Tim 2:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Tim%202%3A23&version=NKJV)).
Not every difference needs to become a division. A guiding principle for Christian unity is this - in essentials, unity;
in non-essentials, liberty; in all things, love. This timeless wisdom from Augustine reminds us to stand firm in
the core truths of the gospel while extending love and grace in secondary issues, always reflecting the love of
Christ in how we relate to others. This diversity should not lead us to division or discouragement - it
should lead us deeper into God's Word and be more committed to the truth of the gospel.
As Christians, we're called to know what we believe and why we believe it - be a living witness for Christ.
Studying Scripture, examining church teachings, and asking hard questions, like
*"Is this teaching faithful to the Bible?"* and *"Does it glorify Christ?"* are essential for spiritual maturity.
At the same time, we must remain humble and avoid a sectarian spirit. Just because
someone worships differently or belongs to another denomination doesn't mean they don't belong to Christ. If they
hold to the gospel, they are our brothers and sisters. Worship style and secondary doctrines should never be
reasons to mock or exclude other believers.

:::tip[The authority of the scripture]

While tradition can be rich and meaningful, it must never replace or override the authority of Scripture. 

:::

We must be willing to let go of practices that don't align with God's Word, even if they're familiar or comfortable.
faithfulness to Christ always comes before comfort in tradition. This posture should lead us to pursue truth with
discernment and grace. At the same time, we should long for unity - not uniformity, but true unity in the essentials
of the faith.

In a world that is increasingly hostile to the gospel, the Church must stand together, across
denominational lines, on the truth of Jesus Christ. The mission is too great, and the Saviour too glorious, for us
to remain divided over what is secondary.

## One Lord, One Faith, One Body

Yes, there are many denominations - but that doesn't mean there are many gospels. There is only one Saviour, Jesus Christ
who died for you and is the only one way to salvation - *"I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me."* ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2014%3A6&version=NKJV)).

People in different denominations are genuine and sincere at heart, and love God the best they know how. 
Denominations reflect our humanity - our cultural differences, theological growth and yes, sometimes our pride.
But they also remind us that no denomination, system or tradition can fully capture the glory of God's Church. The Church
is not a building or a label; it's the redeemed people of God, united by faith in Christ.

If you're looking for answers, know this - *you don't need a denomination to be saved*. **You need a Saviour**. We were all
sinners - broken, lost and separated from God ([Rom 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%203%3A23&version=NKJV)).
No religious system can fix that. Only Jesus can. He came to live the life we couldn't live, die the death we deserved and
rise again so we could be reconciled to God. Salvation is not found in rituals or rules - it's found in a person - Jesus Christ.

[Romans 10:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%2010%3A13&version=NKJV) says *"Everyone who calls on 
the name of the Lord will be saved"*. So whether you come from a church background or none at all, the invitation is the
same - Come to Christ. Repent of your sin, trust in His finished work, [and receive the gift of eternal life](../../jesus/because-he-lives/new-identity-in-christ.mdx).

Let the variety of Christian expressions not distract you, but draw you to the heart of the gospel - one Lord, one faith, one body.
And whether you're a believer or just beginning your search, **let it drive you to know Christ more deeply, study His Word more
faithfully, and love His people more sincerely.**
