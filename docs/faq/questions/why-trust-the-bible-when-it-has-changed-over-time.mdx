# Why Trust the Bible When it has Changed Over Time?

When skeptics ask, *Hasn't the Bible changed over time?* they often raise concerns about potential
errors, alterations or inconsistencies that might have occurred during the centuries of copying,
translation, and transmission. They may wonder whether the Bible we read today accurately reflects
the original writings. The good news for those who seek the truth is that the core message of the
Bible has not only remained remarkably consistent, but it has also been remarkably well-preserved
through history. This article explores why the Bible's message has not changed, emphasizing the
evidence from manuscript counts, discoveries like the Dead Sea Scrolls, fulfilled prophecies
and historical verifications that support its integrity.


## The Abundance of Ancient Biblical Manuscripts

One of the strongest proofs that the Bible has not changed over time is the incredible number and
age of its manuscripts. The New Testament, for example, boasts over 5000 Greek manuscripts alone.
This number dwarfs the manuscript counts of virtually every other ancient work, such as the writings
of Caesar or Plato. Caesar's Gallic Wars survives in just about ten manuscripts, and Plato's works
are preserved in fewer than seven. In contrast, the New Testament, whose earliest fragments date
back to within a mere 100 years of the original writings, has over 24000 manuscript witnesses when
you include those in other ancient languages like Latin, Syriac, and Coptic.

This overwhelming number of manuscripts gives scholars an unparalleled ability to cross-check and
compare texts. **The result is that the New Testament has been preserved with 99.5% textual purity**,
and the few variations that do exist - often minor spelling differences or copyist errors - don't
affect the meaning or theological message of the text. This level of preservation would be unthinkable
for most ancient writings, where surviving manuscripts are often much more limited and much farther
removed from the original autographs.

Early fragments like the Rylands Papyrus (P52), dated to around 125 AD, preserve portions of the
Gospel of John, and these texts were copied only a few decades after the original Gospel was written.
This close proximity between the original texts and the earliest copies strengthens the case that
the Bible has remained remarkably faithful to its original form.

:::tip[The Bible the most historically attested document in antiquity]

No other ancient text has so many early, independent copies. The sheer volume and closeness of these manuscripts to the 
originals make the Bible the most historically attested document in antiquity.

:::

Dr. Bruce Metzger, one of the foremost New Testament academic scholars says *"The textual variations in the New Testament
manuscripts are relatively insignificant in terms of the substance of Christian doctrine."*
Even Dr. Bart Ehrman, a non Christian and a New Testament scholar and well known critic of the textual scholarship of
the New Testament says that he agrees with Dr. Metzger, in his book *Misquoting Jesus*.

:::info[[Misquoting Jesus](https://www.amazon.com/Misquoting-Jesus-Story-Behind-Changed/dp/0060859512), Dr. Bart Ehrman, pg 252]

If he and I were put in a room and asked to hammer out a consensus statement on what we think the original text of the
New Testament looked like, there would be very few points of disagreement ... **The position I argue for in Misquoting
Jesus does not actually stand at odds with Prof. Metzger's position that the essential Christian beliefs are not affected
by textual variants in the manuscript tradition of the New Testament.**

## The Dead Sea Scrolls and Their Role in Preservation

One of the most significant archaeological discoveries in biblical history came in 1947 with the finding
of [the Dead Sea Scrolls near Qumran](../../bible/credibility/acheological-support.mdx#the-dead-sea-scrolls).
These ancient scrolls, some of which date back to the 3rd century BC, contain copies of almost every book
of the Old Testament. The importance of these scrolls lies not only in their age but in the incredible
consistency they show with later manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible.

The Dead Sea Scrolls were written nearly a thousand years before the oldest known Hebrew manuscripts that
existed prior to their discovery. Yet, when scholars compared the scrolls to later texts, they found an
astonishing word for word agreement between the two such, with the small differences being mostly minor
spelling variations. 

:::tip[The Dead Sea scrolls verify the Bible!]

The Isaiah Scrolls proved to be **word-for-word identical** with the standard Hebrew Bible in more than 95%
of the text, confirming the accuracy and reliability of the Masoretic Text. 

:::

**This finding shattered the assumption that the Hebrew Bible might have undergone significant changes or
corruption over the centuries.** In fact, it showed that the texts had been copied with incredible care
and consistency. The message of the Old Testament, as preserved in the scrolls, **remained remarkably intact
over the course of a millennium.** These scrolls are also important because they include prophetic writings
like the Book of Isaiah, which show that prophecies written long before their fulfillment remain unchanged.
Such discoveries strongly suggest that the Bible has been faithfully transmitted across generations.

## The Prophetic Accuracy

A defining feature of the Bible is its prophetic nature. The Bible contains hundreds of prophecies, many of
which were fulfilled long after they were written. Skeptics often question whether these prophecies were
written after the events they predict, but the discovery of ancient texts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls,
conclusively refutes this notion. 

For example **Daniel's Prophecy of the Rise and Fall of Empires**. The book of Daniel, written
around 600–530 BC, contains prophetic visions of world empires that align
precisely with post-Daniel history. In [Daniel 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel%202&version=NKJV),
King Nebuchadnezzar dreams of a statue made of different metals, representing successive kingdoms. Even the secular atheistic scholars
widely agree that these represent:

1. Babylon (gold head) - circa 609-539 BC
2. Medo-Persia (silver chest) - circa 539-331 BC
3. Greece (bronze thighs) - circa 331-63 BC
4. Rome (iron legs) - circa 63 BC-476 AD

**These empires rose and fell in the exact order prophesied.** 6 centuries of history laid out in the exact order
of the empires that rule the earth! *Thats not coincidence.*

Another one is **Daniel's seventy weeks prophecy** [Daniel 9:24–27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%209%3A24%E2%80%9327&version=NKJV),
which gives a time prophecy:
*"From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One (Messiah) comes,
there will be seven 'sevens' and sixty-two 'sevens'... " (v.25)*

Using Jewish prophetic reckoning (a 'week' is 7 years), this gives:

7 + 62 = 69 weeks = 483 years

Starting point: decree to rebuild Jerusalem (~457 BC, [Ezra 7:11–26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra%207%3A11%E2%80%9326&version=NKJV))

483 years later = AD 27, the approximate start of Jesus' public ministry

**Many scholars (e.g., Gleason Archer, Josh McDowell) affirm that this prophecy predicts the arrival of the Messiah to the year.**

Coincidence? With this much of accuracy - is that even possible? 

Similarly, **Micah's prophecy** ([Micah 5:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=micah%205%3A2&version=NKJV))
foretold that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem - a detail fulfilled in the birth of Jesus 700 years later.

The Bible contains over 2,500 prophecies, and approximately 2,000 of them have already been fulfilled. This
is an extraordinary record, especially when the odds of these prophecies being fulfilled by chance are astronomically low.
For example, the mathematical probability of one person fulfilling just eight of the Bible's messianic prophecies is estimated
to be 1 in 10<sup>17</sup>, yet
[Jesus fulfilled more than 350 prophecies](../../jesus/crediblilty/prophecies-fulfilled.md#350-prophecies-fulfilled-by-jesus).
The Bible's ability to accurately predict future events is one of the strongest arguments for its divine inspiration.

Many critics, however, suggest that these prophecies may have been written after the events they describe. Yet the existence
of the Dead Sea Scrolls and their dating to a period before many of these prophecies were fulfilled shows that this theory
is unfounded. The scrolls contain many of the prophecies that would later be fulfilled in the life of Jesus, and their 
pre-fulfillment dating confirms the Bible's prophetic accuracy.

## Archaeological Evidence - The Bible's Historical Reliability

Archaeology has also played a significant role in affirming the Bible's accuracy. Numerous archaeological discoveries
have confirmed the historical accuracy of biblical events, places and people. For instance, the Mesha Stele, discovered
in Jordan, contains a reference to King Omri of Israel and his son Ahab, figures mentioned in the Bible's Old Testament.
The Pool of Bethesda, once thought to be a biblical legend, was uncovered in Jerusalem, aligning perfectly with the
description found in the Gospel of John. Similarly, excavations at sites like Megiddo, Hazor and Gezer have unearthed
ancient ruins that match the biblical timeline, corroborating the historical events recorded in Scripture.

Moreover, inscriptions such as the [Tel Dan Stele](../../bible/credibility/acheological-support.mdx#house-of-david), which
mentions the *House of David*, provide external confirmation of the existence of King David, a central figure in
biblical history. These discoveries provide tangible evidence that the people, places, and events described in the Bible
were real and historically accurate. Archaeology does not contradict the Bible; rather, it consistently affirms its
trustworthiness.

## The Bible's Core Message Has Remained Unchanged after 2000 years

Given the overwhelming manuscript evidence, the accuracy of biblical prophecy, the preservation of texts like
the Dead Sea Scrolls, and the corroboration of historical and archaeological findings, we can confidently assert
that the Bible has not changed over time in any meaningful way. While there are minor textual variations - none of which
affect the essential theological or historical message - the Bible we read today remains faithful to the ancient texts.

This consistency of message across millennia is a testament to the careful transmission of Scripture by scribes and the
providential preservation of God's Word. From the earliest manuscripts to the most modern translations, the core truths
of the Bible - the message of salvation, grace and hope - have remained unchanged. And this is why the Bible continues
to be a source of profound spiritual guidance and historical reliability for believers and seekers alike.

In a world where truth is often questioned, the Bible stands as an enduring testament to the faithfulness of God, not
only in the message it communicates but also in the way He has preserved it across time. Whether through prophecy,
manuscript evidence, or archaeological discoveries, the Bible's integrity remains unshaken, proving that the Word of
God is as reliable today as it has always been. The core message - of Creation, Fall, Redemption and Restoration - is
the same message God preserved across time. That's why Christians from every era and language can still share the same
story and hope.

We invite you to explore the Bible, compare the manuscripts for yourself. Don't take our word for it - thanks to the internet
the world is a very small place today! We encourage you to read Isaiah, Daniel and the Gospels yourself. Engage with fulfilled
prophecy and historical excavations. Because when you see how meticulously God preserved His Word, you'll understand
why its message stands firm today. 

:::tip[Get to know the Author]

The Bible can be trusted, not because men wrote it, but because the Holy Spirit inspired it. And those who know its Author
find in its pages not just information, but transformation!

:::

When skeptics question the Bible, they often do so without ever asking the true Author what He meant. The Holy Spirit, who
inspired the Scriptures, is still present today to guide, convict, and reveal truth to those who seek it.

Rather than dismissing the Bible as an old book, why not ask God to open your eyes as He did ours and many more? Just as
we were taken from darkness into light, so too can you encounter the living
Word - [Jesus Christ](../../jesus/because-he-lives/i-can-face-tomorrow.md) - and the written Word that
testifies of Him.
