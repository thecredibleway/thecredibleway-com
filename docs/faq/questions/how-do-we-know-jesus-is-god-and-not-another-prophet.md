# How Do We Know Jesus is God and Not Just Another Prophet?

The claim that Jesus of Nazareth is not merely a wise teacher, a moral exemplar or a significant
prophet, but God incarnate, lies at the very heart of Christian faith. This audacious assertion sets
Christianity apart from other religions and philosophies. For many, accepting Jesus as God seems
like a leap of faith, yet Christian apologetics offers a robust body of evidence, inviting a rational
and informed understanding of this core principle. So, how do we know Jesus is God and not just another prophet?

## The Explicit Claims of Jesus Himself

Perhaps the most direct evidence comes from Jesus' own words and actions recorded in the Gospels. While
some argue that Jesus never explicitly said, *"I am God"*, His claims were consistently understood by
His contemporaries, both followers and opponents, as assertions of divinity.

#### The *"I AM"* Statements

In the Gospel of John, Jesus repeatedly uses the divine title "I AM" (Greek: Eg≈ç eimi), echoing God's
revelation of Himself to Moses in [Exodus 3:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%203%3A14&version=NKJV).
When Jesus declared, *"Before Abraham was, I AM"* 
([John 8:58](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A58&version=NKJV)), the Jewish leaders
immediately understood this as a claim to deity and attempted to stone Him for blasphemy
([John 8:59](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A59&version=NKJV)). Other "I AM" statements,
like *"I am the bread of life"* ([John 6:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A35&version=NKJV)),
*"I am the light of the world"* ([John 8:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A32&version=NKJV)),
*"I am the good shepherd"* ([John 10:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A11&version=NKJV)),
*"I am the resurrection and the life"* ([John 11:25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A25&version=NKJV))
and *"I am the way, the truth and the life"* ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A6&version=NKJV)),
all point to His unique, divine identity and indispensable role in salvation - privileges belonging only to God.

#### Claims of Oneness with the Father

Jesus unequivocally stated, *"I and the Father are one"*
([John 10:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A30&version=NKJV)). Again, the Jews sought
to stone Him, accusing Him of blasphemy because, *"being a man, you make yourself God"*
([John 10:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A33&version=NKJV)). 
This wasn't a misunderstanding; it was a correct interpretation of His divine claim.
He is also called the *"Son of God"* in [Matthew 16:16(https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2016%3A16&version=NKJV)]
and *"Christ"* which means "Anointed One of God" in the same verse.

#### Authority to Forgive Sins

When Jesus healed a paralytic and declared, *"Son, your sins are forgiven"*
([Mark 2:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%202%3A5&version=NKJV)),
the scribes questioned His authority, reasoning, "Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
([Mark 2:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mark%202%3A7&version=NKJV)). Jesus then
demonstrated His authority to forgive sins by also healing the man, directly linking His divine power
over physical ailments to His divine power over spiritual ones. Jesus could forgive sins and heal; His
death on the cross also covered both.
[Isa 53:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2053%3A5&version=NKJV) says, *"But He was
wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; ... and by His stripes we are healed."*

#### Acceptance of Worship

Unlike prophets who consistently refused worship, directing it only to God
([Acts 10:25-26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=%20Acts%2010%3A25-26%29&version=NKJV)), Jesus
accepted worship. The blind man whose sight was restored worshipped Jesus
([John 9:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%209%3A38&version=NKJV)) and after
the resurrection, Thomas declared, *"My Lord and my God!"*
([John 20:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020%3A28&version=NKJV)), to which Jesus
responded not with a rebuke, but an affirmation, *"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed
are those who have not seen and yet have believed"* ([John 20:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020%3A29&version=NKJV)).
In [Revelation 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%205%3A12&version=NKJV), angels
and holy beings worship Him alongside the Father *"Worthy is the Lamb...to receive power and wealth and
wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise!"*

:::tip[Jesus understood Himself as God because He is God]

These direct and implicit claims within the Gospels reveal Jesus' self-understanding as more than a prophet;
He understood Himself as God.

## The Fulfillment of Old Testament Prophecies

The Old Testament contains hundreds of prophecies concerning the coming Messiah. While many prophets spoke about
God or delivered messages from God, Jesus fulfilled prophecies that pointed directly to His divine nature and unprecedented role.
In fact [He fulfilled more than 350 prophecies](../../jesus/crediblilty/prophecies-fulfilled.md#350-prophecies-fulfilled-by-jesus),
this is something one one in all of history has even come close to. 

#### Divine Origin and Eternal Nature
[Micah 5:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=micah%205%3A2&version=NKJV) prophesied that the ruler
from Bethlehem would have *"origins from of old, from ancient times"* (or *"from everlasting"*), hinting at a
pre-existent, eternal being. [Isaiah 9:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isa%209%3A6&version=NKJV) 
speaks of a child born who would be called *"Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace"*.
These titles are clearly divine.

#### Suffering Servant Who is God
[Isaiah 53](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isa%2053&version=NKJV) describes a *suffering servant* who
would bear the sins of many. This Messianic prophecy,
[uniquely fulfilled in Jesus' sacrificial death](../../bible/credibility/prophecies-fulfilled.md#isaiah-52-and-53---the-suffering-servant),
speaks of a redemptive work only God could accomplish.

#### The King and Judge
Many prophecies depict the Messiah as a divine king and judge
([Psa 2:6-12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%202%3A6-12&version=NKJV),
[Dan 7:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%207%3A13-14&version=NKJV)). Jesus' will to judge
the living and the dead
([John 5:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%205%3A22&version=NKJV),
[Matt 25:31-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2025%3A31-46&version=NKJV)) align
with these prophecies, demonstrating authority that transcends any mere human prophet.

The [sheer number and specificity of prophecies fulfilled by Jesus](../../jesus/crediblilty/prophecies-fulfilled.md#350-prophecies-fulfilled-by-jesus),
particularly those hinting at His divine nature, are difficult to explain as mere coincidence or fabrication.

## His Miraculous Power and Authority

Jesus' miracles were not just isolated acts of wonder; they were demonstrations of divine power and authority
over creation, disease, demons and even death itself. Unlike prophets who performed miracles through the
power of God, Jesus performed miracles by His own authority.

#### Authority over Nature

Calming the storm with a word ([Mark 4:35-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%204%3A35-41&version=NKJV)),
walking on water ([Matt 14:22-33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2014%3A22-33&version=NKJV)),
and multiplying loaves and fish to feed thousands
([Matt 14:15-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2014%3A15-21&version=NKJV)) showcased His
sovereignty over the natural world, a power attributed to God in the Old Testament
([Psa 89:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2089%3A9&version=NKJV)).

#### Authority over Disease and Death

Jesus healed all manner of diseases, often instantly and completely, including those considered incurable.
Most strikingly, He raised several individuals from the dead, including Lazarus, who had been dead for four
days ([John 11:1-44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011%3A1-44&version=NKJV)),
and ultimately, He claimed the power to raise Himself from the dead
([John 2:19-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%202%3A19-21&version=NKJV),
[John 10:17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A17-18&version=NKJV)).
**No prophet in history ever claimed or demonstrated such inherent power over life and death**.

These miracles served as unmistakable signs, validating His claims and demonstrating that the power
of God was not merely with Him, but in Him.

## The Resurrection of Jesus

The [resurrection of Jesus from the dead](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md) is the cornerstone
of Christian faith and arguably the most powerful evidence for His divinity. It is the ultimate vindication
that He is God.

:::tip[The simplest answer to everything]

Jesus Christ - the ultimate Occam's Razor!

:::


#### Historical Evidence

Let's say you dismiss the eyewitness accounts of the Jewish people, Jesus' followers, the New Testament,
and what your Christian friends say. **But can you really ignore what Roman and Syrian historians recorded?**
These weren't just ordinary men-they were legal experts and could think for themselves - Roman senators,
and provincial governors. **If anything, their testimony as hostile sources, is especially valuable and
considered the most credible since they had no reason to favor Jesus or His followers.**

The Romans were certainly no friends of Jesus Christ or His followers - quite the opposite in fact!
They scourged Jesus, gave Him a crown of thorns, mocked Him, crucified Him and later persecuted
His followers the same way. And yet, [their own historical records acknowledge Jesus Christ, the early church,
and the surprising spread of Christianity](./how-do-we-know-jesus-rose-from-the-dead.md).

**If the resurrection of Jesus from the dead was not real, why was the message of Jesus spreading rapidly?
Why were people willing to lose everything; be tortured and killed in such painful ways?**

The resurrection is attested to by numerous eyewitnesses
([1 Cor 15:3-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015%3A3-8&version=NKJV)), including
those who were initially skeptical i.e., Thomas.

The [empty tomb](./how-do-we-know-jesus-rose-from-the-dead.md#the-empty-tomb---a-puzzling-absence), the
[transformed lives of the disciples](./how-do-we-know-jesus-rose-from-the-dead.md#cowardice-to-courage---the-radical-transformation-of-the-disciples),
and [the rapid spread of Christianity in the face of persecution](./how-do-we-know-jesus-rose-from-the-dead.md#the-birth-and-rapid-growth-of-the-early-church)
are all historical data points that lend credence to the resurrection.

#### God's Affirmation

The New Testament consistently presents the resurrection not merely as a resuscitation, but as God's divine
*signature* on Jesus' life, teachings and claims. As [Romans 1:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%201%3A4&version=NKJV)
states, Jesus *"was declared with power to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead"*.
It was God's definitive act demonstrating that Jesus was indeed who He claimed to be.

#### Conquest over Death

Only God, the author of life, possesses the power to conquer death permanently. Jesus' resurrection,
unlike other instances of people being brought back to life (like Lazarus), was a triumph over death itself,
leading to an eternal, glorified body - signaling His divine nature.

The [alternative explanations for the resurrection](./how-do-we-know-jesus-rose-from-the-dead.md#the-insufficiency-of-alternative-theories---why-they-fail)
(hallucination, theft of the body, etc) fail to adequately account for the breadth and depth of the evidence
and the historical impact.

## The Response of Early Christians and Martyrs

The immediate and unwavering belief of Jesus' earliest followers in His divinity,
[even to the point of martyrdom](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-martyrs.md), provides powerful testimony.

#### Worship of Jesus

From the earliest days, Christians worshipped Jesus as God. [Pliny the Younger](./how-do-we-know-jesus-rose-from-the-dead.md#pliny-the-younger-gaius-plinius-caecilius-secundus), a Roman governor in the early 2nd century, noted that Christians
met *"before daylight on a stated day to chant verses to Christ as to a God"* (Letter to Trajan, c. 112 AD). 
This practice was revolutionary in a monotheistic Jewish context and dangerous in a polytheistic Roman one,
yet they persisted.

#### Martyrdom for the Belief

Many early Christians, [including the apostles, suffered brutal deaths](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-martyrs.md#what-happened-to-the-apostles)
rather than recant their belief in Jesus as God. People die for their beliefs, but they never willingly die
for what they know to be a lie. The conviction of the early martyrs, who were eyewitnesses or directly
connected to eyewitnesses, underscores their profound certainty in Jesus' divine identity, confirmed by His resurrection.

:::tip[The Apostles Martyred]

People die for their beliefs; but they never willingly die for what they know to be a lie.

#### Theological Development

The early church councils, understanding the profound implications of Jesus' identity, consistently
affirmed His full deity (the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, which articulated the doctrine of the Trinity and
the *homoousios* i.e., of the same substance - with the Father). This wasn't an invention, but a
formalization of beliefs already present from the apostolic age, rooted in Jesus' own claims and the
experiences of His followers.


## The Unique Nature of Jesus Compared to Other Prophets

While Jesus is often called a prophet, understanding Him only as a prophet falls short of the full
biblical witness and historical reality.

Prophets spoke with derivative authority (*Thus says the Lord*). Jesus spoke with inherent authority (*But **I** say to you...*)
He did not merely transmit God's message; He is God's message, the Word made flesh
([John 1:1, 14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1%2C14&version=NKJV)).

Prophets were servants of God. Jesus consistently referred to God as *My Father* in a unique
and intimate way, demonstrating a relationship of equality and divine sonship.

Prophets pointed to the coming of God's kingdom and the Messiah. Jesus inaugurated that kingdom and
is the Messiah, the fulfillment of all prophecy. His purpose was not just to speak for God, but to be
[God's ultimate revelation and the means of salvation](../../jesus/because-he-lives/i-can-face-tomorrow.md).

Unlike all other human beings, including prophets; Jesus lived a sinless life, a fact acknowledged
even by His adversaries ([John 8:46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%208%3A46&version=NKJV)).
This moral perfection aligns with His divine nature, as God alone is perfectly holy.

## Jesus is Lord and Savior

The cumulative weight of the evidence points compellingly to Jesus as God, not merely another prophet.
His [miraculous demonstrations of divine power](#his-miraculous-power-and-authority),
the [undeniable fact of His resurrection](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md), 
[the widespread worship](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-martyrs.md#early-records-and-history) and
[martyrdom of early Christians](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-martyrs.md), 
and [His unique nature](./how-can-christianity-be-the-only-true-religion.md) in comparison to all
other religious figures is overwhelming.

:::tip[Jesus is Lord and Savior]

If He were a prophet only, His claims collapse; but He stands undiminished under scrutiny - Lord
and Savior, worthy of faith and adoration.

:::

To accept Jesus as merely a good teacher or prophet while dismissing Him as God creates an untenable
position, as C.S. Lewis who was once a stoic atheist, famously argued *"Either this man was and is,
the Son of God or else a madman or something worse"*. 
While faith remains an essential component of Christian belief, this faith is not blind. It is a faith
grounded in historical inquiry and supported by a robust body of evidence. The fact that Jesus is God
is not merely a theological doctrine; it is a historical event that profoundly altered the course of
human history and continues to offer hope and meaning to billions worldwide. 

To us, the evidence is clear. We also understand that it's not that way for everyone. So
we'd ask you to stay humble and pursue truth where it leads you even if you don't like it.
Truth is not mine or yours - it's truth for everyone and that's what makes it truth. Follow truth!

Buddha said he was a *seeker of truth*, Muhammed said he was a *prophet of truth*,
Jesus said he **is the truth**.

Jesus is credible, therefor what He said is also credible! I have to believe what He says. **It
is no longer about my personal opinion.** There is only one God - Jehovah, who has revealed Himself
through scripture, through His Son Jesus Christ. He 
[offers not only the way to eternal life](../../jesus/because-he-lives/new-identity-in-christ.mdx)
but also the assurance of that life, based on a relationship with God rather than our own merit.
