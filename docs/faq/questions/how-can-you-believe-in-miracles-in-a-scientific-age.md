# How can you believe in miracles in a scientific age?
For many, belief in miracles seems outdated. We live in an age of scientific progress, where natural explanations are sought for everything from thunder to disease. So how can we seriously believe in virgin births, resurrections, or supernatural healings?

It’s important to understand that Christianity is not against science. In fact, many of the greatest scientific minds in history—such as Isaac Newton, Johannes Kepler and Blaise Pascal—were devout Christians who saw their scientific work as a way of understanding God's creation.

Science explains how the world usually works. Miracles, by definition, are exceptions to that order—rare moments when God acts in a special way. To say that miracles are impossible because they don't conform to the regular laws of nature is like saying surprise parties can’t exist because they don’t happen every day.

The central miracle of Christianity is the resurrection of Jesus. If this event really happened, it changes everything. Christianity rises or falls on this claim. That’s why Christian apologists like William Lane Craig, Gary Habermas and others have made historical arguments for the resurrection, showing that the evidence points toward something extraordinary.

Explain laws didn't come about because we found them - they exist because of the Creator
