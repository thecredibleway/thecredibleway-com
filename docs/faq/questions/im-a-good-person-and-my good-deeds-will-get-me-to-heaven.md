title: I'm a good person and good deeds will get me to heaven
description: This addresses the common belief that good deeds are enough to secure a place in heaven. The Bible however says that everyone has sinned and fallen short; and explains salvation by grace through faith, i.e., no one is 'good' enough on their own to earn salvation. It highlights the role of Christ's sacrifice and the need for personal repentance and faith in Jesus Christ as the only way to eternal life.
