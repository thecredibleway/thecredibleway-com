# Would you Sacrifice Your Child if God Asked?

The question can be deeply unsettling, but at the same time, it can lead us to a richer understanding of faith,
obedience and sacrificial love. The answer isn't simply about the act itself but about the heart, trust and
relationship one has with God. At the heart of this question lies a biblical concept that transcends the pages
of Scripture - a love so profound that it leads to sacrifice. This type of love is not only showcased in the acts
of biblical characters like Abraham but is ultimately fulfilled in God's sacrifice of His own Son for the 
of humanity.

Let us dive deeper into what this sacrifice represents, how it shapes our understanding of God's love, and what our
response should be.

## Sacrificial Love - A Concept Rooted in Scripture

Throughout the Bible, God uses the concept of sacrifice to teach His people about love and the consequences of sin.
One of the most striking aspects of this love is that it often involves giving up something of immense value, sometimes
even life itself. The Old Testament, in particular, is rich with the imagery of sacrifices for sin - sacrifices of
animals, grains and so on - which all point to God's plan for redemption. *However, these sacrifices are incomplete
without the ultimate sacrifice* - ***the giving of God's Son, Jesus Christ***.

In the Old Testament, sacrifices were central to the worship and redemption practices of the Israelites. One
particular type of sacrifice that stands out is the *spotless lamb*. The lamb represented purity, innocence and
perfection. To sacrifice a lamb required great devotion because it symbolized an offering of something blameless
and pure to cover a person's sin. The death of the lamb was both tragic and powerful. Its blood would cover
sins temporarily, pointing forward to the ultimate sacrifice where true and lasting atonement would be made for
your sin and mine.

However, in this context, consider the sacrifice of the *lamb* in the form of a child. Abraham's willingness to
give up Isaac, his long-awaited son, is an act of sacrifice that mirrors the heart-wrenching act of God's ultimate
sacrifice in sending His Son to die for the sins of the world. Abraham's obedience to God, even in the most
excruciating of circumstances, was a demonstration of trust and love. The depth of this sacrifice becomes
even more profound when we remember that Abraham loved Isaac deeply, as he was the child of God's promise. 

:::tip[The correct question]

The real question here isn't *Why would God ask Abraham to sacrifice his son?* but more correctly,

**Why would God, the Creator of heaven and earth, sacrifice *His* son, for sinful humans like you and for me?**

This is the ultimate proof of God's love - a sacrifice that was not given reluctantly but freely, for our benefit.

:::

**The Covenant with Abraham was his son for God's Son, so that God through Jesus could get legal entry into
this world by a human body and save us by paying the price for your sin and mine**.
[Genesis 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%2022&version=NKJV) is a type or foreshadowing of
Jesus' sacrifice - with the ram caught in the thicket representing the substitutionary sacrifice of Christ.
The ram, provided by God, took the place of Isaac; just as Jesus took the place of humanity on the cross. 

## Abraham's Sacrifice - A Test of Faith and Love

In [Genesis 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2022&version=NKJV), God commands Abraham
to sacrifice his son Isaac. Many wonder how God could ask such a thing? Why would a loving God demand such
a sacrifice?

The answer lies in the nature of Abraham's relationship with God. Abraham was not being asked to sacrifice Isaac
because God needed a blood offering. Abraham's obedience was a reflection of the deep trust he had in God. God
had promised Abraham that Isaac would be the father of a great nation
([Gen 17:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%2017%3A19&version=NKJV)), and yet now God was
asking him to give up the very child through whom that promise would be fulfilled. **This command, though harrowing,
demonstrated the depth of Abraham's trust in God's character and His ability to keep His promises.**

Abraham knew that God was good, that He was faithful, and that He was capable of bringing life even from death.

:::

What is even more remarkable is that Abraham's obedience foreshadowed God's own sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ.
Just as Abraham was willing to give up his beloved Isaac, God gave up His Son, Jesus, who was not only a child but
the Son of God Himself. The crucifixion of Christ was the ultimate expression of love and sacrifice, one that would
forever change the course of human history.

## The Prophetic Meaning Behind Abraham's Sacrifice

The sacrifice of Isaac was not only a test of Abraham's faith but also a prophecy of the ultimate sacrifice.
Just as Abraham was willing to offer his beloved son, so would God offer His only Son to die on behalf of humanity.
This act would not be for an individual family or nation, but for the salvation of the entire world.

**Abraham's love for Isaac, and his willingness to give him up, was a display of the right order of affections.**
For Abraham, God was the ultimate priority, and Isaac was a gift given to him by God. The challenge for Abraham
was not whether he loved Isaac but whether he loved God more. His willingness to sacrifice Isaac demonstrated
that he valued his relationship with God more than anything else, including the promises and blessings that God
had given him. 

:::info[Value the giver of the gift, more than the gift]

**Abraham valued the giver of the gift of Isaac, more than the gift of Isaac**.

The apostle Paul writes in [Romans 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%205%3A8&version=NKJV),
*"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."*
This is the ultimate proof of God's love - a sacrifice that was not given reluctantly but freely, for our benefit.

## No More Sacrifices - Christ's Sacrifice Is Complete

The Bible tells us that after Christ's death and resurrection, there is no longer any need for further sacrifices
for the forgiveness of sins. The sacrifice of Jesus, the *spotless Lamb of God*, was sufficient once and for all.
His death on the cross provides the eternal evidence of God's love for humanity. This means that God no longer
requires any animal sacrifices or even human sacrifices. The only sacrifice God asks from us is our lives as
*living sacrifices* i.e, to live for God and not for self.

:::tip[God gave His very best]

God gave His very best, so that you could be a child of God, part of His family.

Jesus took your place and mine at the cross and willingly paid the penalty for your sin and mine.

[Romans 12:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%2012%3A1&version=NKJV) says, *"I beseech you therefore,
brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is
your reasonable service."* This *living sacrifice* is not a physical death but a daily laying down of our wills, desires
and ambitions for God's will. **To present our bodies as living sacrifices means to live in constant surrender to God,
just as Christ lived a life of total surrender to the Father**. It is our reasonable service, a response to the incredible
love God has shown us.

## Resisting Wrong Voices - God Will Not Ask for Unjust Sacrifices

It is important to note that while God calls for us to present our bodies as living sacrifices i.e, to live like Jesus 
in constant surrender to God; **He does not ask us to sacrifice our children or any innocent life**. If you
ever hear a voice telling you to harm your child, that voice is not from God. God's Word clearly
forbids the taking of innocent life ([Exod 20:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exo%2020%3A13&version=NKJV)),
and any voice urging such a thing is not from God. It is crucial to resist such voices, whether they come from our own
sinful minds or from evil spiritual forces. **God cannot violate His Word and He will not ask you to sacrifice your child
or any innocent life - Jesus has already paid the price when He died on the cross and shed His blood.**

In moments of spiritual confusion or distress, it is essential to stay grounded in the truth of God's word. As Paul
instructs in [Ephesians 6:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206%3A12&version=NKJV), we are
engaged in spiritual warfare and must put on the armour of God to withstand the enemy's attacks. By standing firm in
faith and seeking counsel from trusted believers, we can resist the lies and remain steadfast in God's truth.

## A Life of Love and Sacrifice

The question of whether you love God or your child more is not one that should be ignored. But it certainly calls us to
examine our relationship with God. Do we love God above all else? Are we willing to surrender everything to Him,
trusting that His plan is greater than our own? Abraham's example shows us what it means to have the right order
of affections. **His faith and obedience were rooted in love for God**. This same love is now expressed through the
sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God [who takes away the sins of the world](../../jesus/because-he-lives/salvation-and-redemption.md)

In response to God's great love for us, our reasonable service is to offer our lives as living sacrifices. As we do so,
we align our affections with God's will, trusting that He knows what is best for us and for the world He created.
