# Does the Bible Allow Slavery?

Slavery is one of the most emotionally and morally charged subjects in any discussion about
the Bible. Critics often point to biblical texts mentioning slavery to claim that Scripture
condones or promotes it. However, a careful study reveals a more nuanced reality - one that
distinguishes between God's perfect will and His permissive will and that ultimately points
toward dignity, freedom and equality in Christ.

## Understanding the Historical Context

When we read the word *slavery* in the Bible, it's crucial to understand that ancient slavery
was vastly different from the race-based chattel slavery that occurred in the modern West.
In biblical times, slavery was often a form of indentured servitude. People became servants for
a variety of reasons - such as debt repayment, poverty or the loss of land. In many cases,
servitude was voluntary and temporary. According to the Old Testament law
([Exod 21:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exo%2021%3A2&version=NKJV)), Hebrew
slaves were to be set free after six years of service, *"If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is
to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything."*
[Slaves were to be treated fairly, receive their just wages, were not to work during the
Sabbath and not to be treated harshly or severely harmed](https://www.dbu.edu/mitchell/early-modern-resources/biblesla.html)
([Exod 20:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exo%2020%3A10&version=NKJV),
 [Job 31:13-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2031%3A13-15&version=NKJV),
 [Deut 24:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut%2024%3A14-15&version=NKJV),
 [Lev 22:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2022%3A11&version=NKJV),
 [Mal 3:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mal%203%3A5&version=NKJV),
 [Lev 19:20-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev%2019%3A20-22&version=NKJV),
 [Exod 21:20-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exo%2021%3A20-32&version=NKJV), 
 [Eph 5:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph%205%3A9&version=NKJV)). 
This practice served more as a social welfare system than institutionalized oppression. It
offered a way for individuals to survive financial crises and was bound by legal and moral
protections.

## God's Perfect Will vs. His Permissive Will

To understand why slavery is even mentioned in the Bible, we must grapple with the difference
between God's perfect will and His permissive will.

God's perfect will is His ideal for creation i.e., justice, love and mutual respect among all
people. This was seen in the Garden of Eden, where no hierarchies, oppression or exploitation
existed. However, after the fall of man, sin entered the world and corrupted human relationships.
As a result, God allowed systems that were less than ideal to exist - not because He endorsed
them, but because of the hardness of human hearts. For example *divorce*, 
([Matt 19:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2019%3A8&version=NKJV)). The same
applies to slavery. Like divorce, slavery was never God's intention. But in a fallen world, He
permitted certain structures temporarily and regulated them in ways that provided more humane
treatment compared to surrounding cultures.

## God Never Commanded People to Own Slaves

It's essential to note that nowhere in Scripture does God command people to acquire slaves. Laws
concerning servitude in the Old Testament were given to limit abuse and provide structure in a
broken world. These laws were actually progressive compared to the brutal systems of the
surrounding ancient Near Eastern nations, where slaves had virtually no rights and could be
treated as property.

In contrast, the Bible teaches that all people are created in the image of God
([Gen 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%201%3A27&version=NKJV)). That
foundational truth undermines any notion of one human being owning another as mere property.

## The Message of Equality in Christ

The clearest expression of God's heart on this matter comes in the New Testament. Through Jesus
Christ, God revealed a radically transformative vision of humanity - one marked by dignity and
equality for all. 

:::tip[Equality like never before]

In [Galatians 3:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A28&version=NKJV), the apostle Paul writes, *"There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female,
for you are all one in Christ Jesus."*

:::

This statement was revolutionary. It shattered social, ethnic and economic barriers,
declaring that in Christ, all believers are equal. Paul didn't just preach this idea - he lived it.

# Paul, Philemon and Onesimus: A New Way Forward
One of the most compelling illustrations of Christian transformation in the face of slavery
is found in Paul's letter to Philemon. In this brief epistle, Paul appeals to Philemon, a
slave owner, regarding a runaway slave named Onesimus.
Paul writes *"Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have
him back, **no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother**"*
([Philemon 15-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philemon%201&version=NKJV)).

Paul doesn't call for an armed rebellion or immediate abolition, but his approach subverts
the institution at its core. He calls Philemon to view Onesimus; **not as property, but as a dear brother
in Christ - an equal.** The seeds of abolition were being planted in the heart of the gospel itself.

## Christian Influence in the End of Slavery

Slavery was not commanded by God but permitted because of human sin, it's no coincidence
that many of the early abolitionists were Christians driven by their
biblical convictions. William Wilberforce in England; Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass in America
all cited their faith as the motivation for opposing slavery. **They understood that the gospel of
Jesus Christ is fundamentally incompatible with the ownership and exploitation of human beings.**

:::info[The Gospel]

The power of the gospel didn't only bring spiritual salvation; it reshaped societal norms and human
relationships. It reminded the world that no one is superior to another based on race, status or wealth.

:::

The trajectory of Scripture moves from regulation to redemption - from managing a broken
system to transforming hearts and societies through Christ. Slavery was never God's perfect
plan for humanity, just as divorce was not. But God worked within human brokenness to point
toward something better.

And that *something better* is found in Jesus Christ, where every human being - is valued,
cherished and made one in Him.
