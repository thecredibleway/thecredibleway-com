# How Can the Bible be Trusted if it was Written by Mere Men?

One of the most common objections to the Bible's authority is this, *"Wasn't it just written by men?"*
To many, this seems like a reasonable question. After all, every book in history was written by human
hands - so what makes the Bible any different? The short answer is that though the Bible was penned by
men, it was authored by God Himself through the power of the Holy Spirit.

To understand why the Bible is trustworthy, we must look beyond a surface-level view of its human authorship and consider
the [nature of its message](../../bible/origins/distinctive-character.md),
[origin](../../bible/origins/crafted-and-inscribed.mdx),
[unity](../../bible/origins/survival-and-resiliency.md)
and [power to transform lives](../../bible/origins/impact-on-civilization.md). *The Bible is unlike any other book
ever written - not because it denies human involvement, but because it proclaims divine inspiration working through humanity.*

## Divine Inspiration Through Human Hands

The Bible itself addresses its origin. In
[2 Timothy 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203%3A16&version=NKJV) we read, *"All Scripture is
God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness."* The term *God-breathed*
(Greek: theopneustos) means that Scripture came directly from God's Spirit. Though it was written over a span of 1500 years
by over 40 human authors - most of which never met each other and were from vastly different backgrounds, it carries a
unified message pointing to Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour.

This is not just a philosophical claim. The Bible contains supernatural insight - knowledge about the future, the human heart,
and the eternal realm - something that no ordinary human could manufacture. Consider
[the hundreds of fulfilled prophecies](../../bible/credibility/prophecies-fulfilled.md), including specific predictions about
[the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus](../../jesus/crediblilty/prophecies-fulfilled.md), written centuries before He was
born. **These were not the guesses of religious philosophers - they were revelations from the mind of God.**

As [2 Peter 1:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20peter%201%3A21&version=NKJV) says, *"Prophecy never had its
origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit."* The human
element is real, but it is the Spirit of God who guided their words.

This is in stark contrast to other religions which teach the opposite - sceptics often claim that *[All religions are paths to
the same god](./arent-all-religions-paths-to-the-same-god.md)*; however [nothing is further than the truth](./arent-all-religions-paths-to-the-same-god.md#the-nature-of-god---personal-vs-impersonal). Some like Buddhism deny the existence of God and focus on enlightenment
by good deeds. Islam teaches a different god in Allah altogether, and Hinduism teaches of 330 million gods.

## The Bible's Power to Transform

Another testimony to the Bible's divine origin is its power to transform lives. It is not merely a rule book or a historical
document - it is a living message from the Creator to His creation. Paul writes in
[Romans 1:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%201%3A16&version=NKJV), *"For I am not ashamed of the gospel,
for it is the power of God unto salvation for everyone who believes."*

**We are not changed by information, but by divine transformation.** The words of Scripture pierce our hearts, open our eyes,
and bring us from spiritual death into eternal life. Jesus Himself said, *"The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and
life"* ([John 6:63](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%206%3A63&version=NKJV)).

When someone receives Christ through the gospel message, they don't just change philosophies - they change eternities. God
opened the eyes of my understanding, delivering me from the darkness of sin and death into His glorious light. **He granted me
the gift of everlasting life and adopted me as His child.** *No mere human message could accomplish that.*

## Faith Is Relational, Not Blind

People often assume that trusting the Bible is a form of blind faith. But that's not how Christians experience it. Just as
a married person doesn't question the existence of their spouse simply because they can't offer *"scientific proof"* of
their love, the Christian walks in daily relationship with God. This is not irrational - it's relational. Jesus said in
[John 17:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2017%3A3&version=NKJV), *"Now this is eternal life - that
they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."*

:::tip[Knowing God]

Knowing God is not merely believing facts about Him - it is walking with Him, talking with Him, hearing His voice through His Word
and obeying His Voice.

:::

Would you call a spouse delusional because they trust in the love and presence of their partner? Of course not. So it is
with the believer and the Word of God. It isn't just a text; it's the voice of our Father.

## The Supernatural Nature of Scripture

The Bible is filled with content that no mere human could fabricate. It doesn't just tell us about history - it tells
us about eternity. It reveals the heart of man and the character of God. It gives hope beyond the grave and peace that
surpasses understanding.

It is often said that the Bible gives *"joy unspeakable and peace unfathomable."* These are not poetic exaggerations.
These come from faith in the promises of God which bring a deep inner transformation. A believer doesn't follow the
Bible because it's convenient (more often than not, it's harder) - but because it reveals the eternal truth that
sets us free.

## Addressing Misunderstandings About Scripture

Sceptics often point to verses that seem confusing or troubling, but that is because they are taken out of context.
One common example is [Deuteronomy 22:28–29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut%2022%3A28-29&version=NKJV),
which many claim teaches that a woman must marry her rapist. This is a gross misunderstanding due to lack of context.

The verses just before ([Deut. 22:25–27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut%2022%3A25-27&version=NKJV))
clearly state that **a man who rapes a woman is to be put to death.** The man, not the woman, bore the consequences for
rape. The passage in verses 28–29 however refer to a different scenario - consensual premarital sex, and not rape. We know
this from v.29 *"... and they are found out,..."* not and *he or she was found out*, implying that both were guilty. The
command to marry was not about punishing the woman, but about taking responsibility in a culture where her future
security would be at risk. In our language today we'd call this a *Shotgun wedding*. 

:::tip[Context is important]

The Bible does not condone evil - it reveals God's heart for justice and love. The Bible's moral law is
clear - love your neighbour as yourself! And love does not rape, kill, or exploit. 

**Scripture is consistent when read in the light of its full message and intent. And that's why context matters!**

Misrepresenting Scripture by ignoring context is like blaming a doctor for a diagnosis without reading the whole report.

:::

Another criticism sceptics raise is the apparent contradiction in
[1 Corinthians 15:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015%3A32&version=NKJV), which says,
*"Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."* Out of context, it sounds like the Bible encourages a reckless,
pleasure-seeking life. But in context, Paul is actually making the **opposite** point - the entire context is found in
[1 Corinthians 15:31-35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015%3A31-35&version=NKJV). He
says that *without the resurrection of the dead, life is meaningless.* If this life is all there is, why not live for
temporary pleasure? But since Christ has risen, we have a purpose beyond this world. That's the beauty of the gospel; 
it doesn't remove our desire for joy, it redirects it to something eternal.

## Ask the Author directly

No other book in human history even compares to the Bible. It's a unified message across millennia, filled with
prophecy, moral wisdom, and divine power. It doesn't just tell us what to do - it changes who we are. If it were merely
the product of man, it would reflect man's flaws, limited knowledge, and shifting moral compass. But instead, we find in
its pages eternal truths that have outlasted kingdoms, cultures, and critics.

[Hebrews 4:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=heb%204%3A12&version=NKJV) declares, *"The word of God is alive
and active, sharper than any double-edged sword... it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart."* 
This is not an ordinary book. It is the voice of God speaking through the ages.

:::tip[Knowing the Author]

The Bible can be trusted, not because men wrote it, but because the Holy Spirit inspired it. And those who know its Author
find in its pages not just information, but transformation!

:::

When sceptics question the Bible, they often do so without ever asking the true Author what He meant. The Holy Spirit, who
inspired the Scriptures, is still present today to guide, convict, and reveal truth to those who seek it.

Rather than dismissing the Bible as a product of men, why not ask God to open your eyes as He did ours and many more? Just as
we were taken from darkness into light, so too can you encounter the living
Word - [Jesus Christ](../../jesus/because-he-lives/i-can-face-tomorrow.md) - and the written Word that
testifies of Him.
