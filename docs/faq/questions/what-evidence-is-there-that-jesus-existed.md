# What Evidence is There That Jesus Existed?

The question of whether Jesus of Nazareth truly existed as a historical figure is fundamental
to understanding the origins of Christianity. While some fringe theories suggest he was a
mythical construct, the overwhelming consensus among mainstream historians, both secular and
religious, is that Jesus was indeed a real person who lived in first-century Judea. The evidence
for his existence comes from a variety of sources, both within and outside of the Christian canon,
and is strengthened by the convergence of these independent testimonies.

## Non-Christian Ancient Historians

Let's say you dismiss the eyewitness accounts of the Jewish people, Jesus' followers, the New Testament,
and what your Christian friends say. **But can you really ignore what Roman and Syrian historians recorded?**
These weren't just ordinary men-they were legal experts and could think for themselves - Roman senators,
and provincial governors. **If anything, their testimony as hostile sources, is especially valuable and
considered the most credible since they had no reason to favor Jesus or His followers.**

The Romans were certainly no friends of Jesus Christ, or His followers - quite the opposite in fact!
They scourged Jesus, gave Him a crown of thorns, mocked Him, crucified Him and later persecuted
His followers the same way. And yet, their own historical records acknowledge Jesus Christ, the early church,
and the surprising spread of Christianity.

**If the resurrection of Jesus from the dead was not real, why was the message of Jesus spreading rapidly?
Why were people willing to lose everything; be tortured and killed in such painful ways?**

Jesus Christ - the ultimate Occam's Razor!

### Roman Historians

#### Tacitus (Publius Cornelius Tacitus)

Tacitus, born in 56 AD, is widely regarded as one of Rome's greatest historians. The most
significant Roman reference to Jesus comes from Cornelius Tacitus, a prominent Roman senator 
and historian. In his *Annals*, written around 116 AD, he covers events from the death of
Augustus to Nero's reign, Tacitus references Jesus while describing Nero's brutal 
persecution of early Christians after the Great Fire of Rome. Importantly, 
there's no evidence of later tampering - his account stands as an authentic Roman record.

:::info[[The Annals 15:44, Tacitus](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Annals_(Tacitus)/Book_15#44)]

But all human efforts, all the lavish gifts of the emperor and the propitiations of the gods, did not
banish the sinister belief that the conflagration was the result of an order. Consequently, to get rid
of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for
their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had it's origin,
suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators,
Pontius Pilatus and a superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea,
the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part
of the world find their centre and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who
pleaded guilty; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the
crime of firing the city, as of hatred against mankind. Mockery of every sort was added to their
deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or were nailed to
crosses, or were doomed to the flames and burnt, to serve as a nightly illumination, when daylight
had expired. 

:::

This passage is widely accepted by scholars as authentic. It confirms several key historical facts
about Jesus such as His name, *Christus* (the Latinized form of Christ), His execution under Pontius
Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea, It also details the origin of the Christian movement in Judea
and its spread to Rome and the persecution of Christians for their allegiance to Christ.

#### Pliny the Younger (Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus)

Pliny the Younger is another valuable Roman historical source for information on Jesus and the early
Church. He was the governor of Bithynia and Pontus (modern day Turkey or Asia Minor as it is referred
to in the New Testament) on the Black Sea coast of Anatolia. He was the representative of Emperor
Trajan between 109 and 111 AD. He even writes to Emperor Trajan asking how he should deal with those
in his region who are accused of being Christians. And in this letter he describes the practices
of these 'criminals':

:::info[[Excerpts from Pliny's letter to Emperor Trajan](https://www.biola.edu/blogs/good-book-blog/2017/what-pliny-the-younger-learned-when-he-interrogated-christians-ca-a-d-110)]

They were in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light, when they sang in
alternate verses a hymn to Christ, as to a god and bound themselves by a solemn oath, not to any
wicked deeds, but never to commit any fraud, theft or adultery, never to falsify their word, nor
deny a trust when they should be called upon to deliver it up; after which it was their custom to
separate and then reassemble to partake of food – but food of an ordinary and innocent kind.

... I believe it all the more necessary to find out the truth from two slave women, whom they
call deaconesses, even by torture. I found nothing but immoderate superstition ... 

The contagion of this superstition was spread not only through towns but also villages and
even rural areas...

:::

Pliny's account confirms that Christians worshipped Christ as God, maintained a high moral
code and were numerous enough to pose a concern for Roman authorities. This letter indicates that
within decades of Jesus' death, a distinct group identified by their worship of *Christ* was well-established.

#### Suetonius (Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus)

Another Roman historian, Suetonius, in his Life of Claudius[Emperor], mentions Jews being expelled from Rome:

:::info[[Claudius 25 - Suetonius on Jesus](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Aabo%3Aphi%2C1348%2C015%3A25)]

He banished from Rome all the Jews, who were continually making disturbances at the instigation
of one Chrestus (anointed one)

:::
The 'disturbances' were Jews who trying to reconcile Jesus' divinity and
the scandalous reports of his resurrection. Since the Jews couldn't agree, they were all expelled. This
suggests Jesus' influence was felt even in the heart of the Roman Empire by the mid-1st century.

#### Flavius Josephus 

Josephus, one of the most respected Roman-Jewish historians of Judea, was born in 37 AD and died in 100 AD.
While he was born a Jew, he later became a Roman citizen and had the backing of the
Roman emperors (Vespasian, Titus and Domitian), Josephus had access to resources and was able to
generate incredible detail in his records, far beyond what the Gospel writers (who lacked wealth)
could achieve. It is because he served under the Roman emperors, his records were valued as authentic.
Living shortly after Jesus and in the same region, his writings offer near eyewitness quality, offering
insights into the era's cultural context. His major works, *Jewish Antiquities* and *The Wars of the Jews*,
chronicle Hebrew history and the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and the fall of Masada in 73 AD. 

:::info[[Antiquities of the Jews 18:63-64 - The accounts of Flavius Josephus about Jesus Christ](https://lexundria.com/j_aj/18.63-64/wst)]

[63] Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man; for he was a doer
of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many
of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. [64] And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the
principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not
forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these
and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are
not extinct at this day.

:::

This core passage confirms Jesus' existence, his reputation as a wise teacher and miracle worker,
his condemnation and crucifixion under Pontius Pilate
([Luke 23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023&version=NKJV)), and the continued
existence of his followers, the Christians.

In reference to James, this shorter passage is almost universally accepted as authentic and refers to Jesus indirectly but clearly:

:::info[[Antiquities of the Jews 20:200 - The accounts of Flavius Josephus about James the brother of Jesus](https://lexundria.com/j_aj/20.200/wst)]

"So he assembled the Sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned."

:::

This reference to *James, the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ,* is a vital piece of
evidence. Josephus, writing independently, clearly knew of a figure named Jesus who was known
as *Christ* and had a brother named James. This firmly grounds Jesus within known historical family
lines and contemporary recognition.

### Early Christian Sources (Outside the New Testament Canon)

Beyond the New Testament, numerous early Christian writings provide further testimony to Jesus' existence
and the beliefs of his followers. These texts, while not canonical, are valuable for understanding the
historical context and the unwavering conviction of early Christians.

#### The Didache
An early (late 1st – early 2nd century AD) Christian manual of doctrine and instruction, the Didache
refers to Jesus' teachings and the practices of the early church, reflecting a community already living
out the implications of his life and ministry.

#### Letters of Clement of Rome 
Clement, an early bishop of Rome, wrote (late 1st century AD) to the Corinthians, citing New Testament
figures and events, indicating that the accounts about Jesus were already well-established and
foundational to Christian identity.

#### Letters of Ignatius of Antioch
Ignatius (early 2nd century AD), was martyred around 107 AD, wrote several letters on his way to Rome.
He repeatedly affirms the real, flesh-and-blood existence of Jesus, his crucifixion under Pontius Pilate,
and his resurrection. He argues strongly against Docetism, a heresy that claimed Jesus only appeared to
be human. His emphasis on Jesus' physical reality underscores that this was a foundational belief.

#### The Gospel of Thomas
While a Gnostic text not included in the New Testament, the Gospel of Thomas (early 2nd century AD)
presents a collection of sayings attributed to Jesus. Its existence demonstrates that various
communities were circulating and collecting Jesus' teachings, even if some interpretations differed from
what became mainstream Christianity.

#### Papias of Hierapolis
Though his work is mostly lost, Papias (early 2nd century AD), as quoted by Eusebius, stated that he
diligently sought out information from those who had known the apostles or had heard from eyewitnesses,
indicating a concern for the historical accuracy of Jesus' story from a very early date.

#### Pauline Epistles
Paul's letters (c. 50-60 AD) are the earliest Christian writings we possess, penned within 20-30 years
of Jesus' crucifixion. Paul frequently refers to Jesus as a historical figure, mentioning his Jewish
descent ([Rom 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201-3&version=NKJV)), his life
*under the law* ([Gal 4:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gal%204%3A4&version=NKJV)), his
death by crucifixion
([1 Cor 1:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%201%3A23&version=NKJV),
[Gal 3:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gal%203%3A1&version=NKJV)), and his resurrection.
Crucially, Paul states that he met with Peter and James, Jesus' brother
([Gal 1:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%201%3A18-19&version=NKJV)), indicating
direct contact with eyewitnesses and family members of Jesus. These are not abstract theological
claims but grounded in a shared understanding of Jesus' historical person.

#### The Gospels
(Mark c. 65-70 AD, Matthew and Luke c. 80-90 AD, John c. 90-100 AD) The four canonical Gospels
present detailed accounts of Jesus' life, ministry, crucifixion, and resurrection. While their
primary purpose is theological, they contain numerous elements consistent with first-century Judean
life. Scholars note the Gospels' familiarity with:

- Geographical details: Accurate descriptions of towns, regions, and physical features of ancient Israel (e.g., Nazareth, Capernaum, Jerusalem, Sea of Galilee).
- Cultural practices: References to Jewish customs, religious festivals, and social norms of the period.
- Political figures: Mentions of Roman governors like Pontius Pilate and local rulers like Herod Antipas, whose historical existence is independently attested.
- Personal names: The prevalence of names common in first-century Judea among Jesus' followers and contemporaries.

The Gospels unanimously report that Jesus' tomb was found empty by women followers - an embarrassing detail
in a patriarchal culture where women's testimonies were undervalued. This lends credibility to the account,
as it is unlikely to have been fabricated. Moreover, the tomb's emptiness was not disputed by the Jewish
or Roman authorities, who instead claimed the body had been stolen - an admission that the tomb was indeed vacant.
It passes the *criteria of authenticity* used by historical Jesus scholars.

## Archaeological Context

While direct archaeological proof of Jesus is not expected (individuals from this period rarely
leave such traces), archaeology continually illuminates the world in which he lived, providing a rich
[context that aligns with the biblical accounts](../../bible/credibility/acheological-support.mdx).

#### Nazareth

Excavations in Nazareth have uncovered evidence of a small, rural village from the first century,
consistent with the Gospels' portrayal of Jesus' humble origins. The discovery of a first-century
dwelling beneath the Sisters of Nazareth Convent by Ken Dark and his team suggests what a house of
that period would have looked like, reinforcing the historical backdrop.

#### Capernaum

Capernaum, on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, plays a key role in the Gospels as the town where
Jesus settled after leaving Nazareth
([Mat 4:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204%3A13&version=NKJV)).
It is the setting for several of his miracles such as
healing a paralytic ([Mark 2:1–12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202%3A1%E2%80%9312&version=NKJV))
and the centurion's servant ([Mat 8:5–13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%208%3A5%E2%80%9313&version=NKJV)) and where he called several
disciples who were fishermen ([Mat 4:18–19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%204%3A18%E2%80%931&version=NKJV)).

Once considered obscure, Capernaum's biblical significance has been affirmed by extensive archaeological
excavations since the late 19th century. Archaeological finds at Capernaum, identified as Jesus'
Galilean base, have revealed a first-century synagogue and houses, including one
traditionally believed to be Peter's house, which was later venerated by early Christians.
These discoveries confirm the existence of the town and its typical Galilean settlement patterns.

A well-preserved limestone synagogue, built atop earlier foundations, stands as a central structure where Jesus
is said to have taught ([John 6:59](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%206%3A59&version=NKJV)).
Excavations have unearthed inscriptions and artifacts confirming active Jewish
worship during Jesus' time, consistent with Gospel accounts.

#### Jerusalem

Extensive archaeological work in Jerusalem has uncovered structures and artifacts dating to the
Second Temple period (including Jesus' time), such as the Pool of Bethesda, the Pool of Siloam, and
the Temple Mount area, all mentioned in the Gospels. The discovery of the Caiaphas ossuary, containing
the bones of a high priest named Caiaphas (who presided over Jesus' trial), further anchors the Gospel
accounts in historical reality.


:::tip[Archaeology catching up with the Bible]

**The Pool of Siloam not only confirms the historical accuracy of the Gospel of John's account** but also provides insights into the
religious and social practices of ancient Jerusalem. The site's excavation has become a focal point for understanding
the interplay between archaeology and biblical.

## Fulfilled Prophecies

One major line of evidence is that Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies written centuries before His birth.
Messianic prophecies predicted that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem, descend from David, arrive from Galilee,
enter Jerusalem on a donkey, be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver, be silent before His accusers, have pierced hands
and feet, have His garments cast lots, be buried with the rich, not have His bones broken, suffer for others' sins,
be crucified, given vinegar to drink, forsaken by His disciples, resurrect three days later, and ascend into heaven
and more. [Jesus Christ fulfilled more than 350 prophecies](../../jesus/crediblilty/prophecies-fulfilled.md) - no one
in all of history has that track record or even close to it.


:::info[Science Speaks, Dr. Peter Stoner, Professor Emeritus of Science at Westmont College]

Now these prophecies were either given by inspiration of God or the prophets just wrote them as they thought they should be. In such a case
the prophets had just one chance in 10<sup>17</sup> of having them come true in any man, but they all came true in Christ! **This means that the
fulfillment of these eight prophecies alone proves that God inspired the writing of these prophecies to such absolute definiteness.**

Dr. Stoner went on to calculate the probability of one person fulfilling 48 prophecies to be 1 in
10<sup>157</sup>. Yet the Bible has more than 350 prophesies that have been fulfilled by Jesus Christ
and some to be fulfilled when He returns. I cannot even begin to fathom the numerical value of
that probability...

Just so you can grasp the magnanimous scale of the prophecies of the coming Messiah,
consider these facts - the size of that number, 1 in 10<sup>157</sup> - there are not
even that many electrons in the known universe! And that number is just for 48 of the 350+ known
Messianic prophecies that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled. 

**Merely fulfilling 48 of these isn't something that can be explained by random chance. Rather, this
points to a divine origin**

No man could write that book, we call the Bible. The Bible was written by kings, generals, shepherds,
priests, over 1600 years, in 3 languages, on 3 continents, totally 66 books. It was written mostly by
authors who had never met each other, who wrote about controversial subjects and yet all 66 books
agree. **You can absolutely stake your life on it's authenticity, authority and trustworthiness. And
you can and should stake your eternal destiny on it also!**

:::

## Jesus Existed, Died, Rose Again and Is Alive

There is a lot of evidences to show that Jesus was alive and credible - even if you discount the Bible,
can you in all good conscience ignore history, ignore well‑documented archeology, ignore scholarly affirmation, ignore a
public crucifixion, ignore the sudden transformational resurrection belief ... While each item alone
invites discussion, collectively they create a compelling historical picture.

Though you may still question the supernatural elements (miracles, resurrection) - you should by now at
least see the historical foundations of Jesus' life, death, impact and the preservation of eyewitness
testimony - are solid. At its core, the best explanation for these converging evidences is that Jesus
was not a myth - but a real person who lived, died, and was raised, witnessed by many.

Perhaps instead of the question *"What evidence is there that Jesus existed?"*, the more important
question is ***"What would cause the Son of Man to do the unthinkable? What made
Him give His life as a substitute for each of us?***

The long and the short of it is you and me - more specifically our sin which has separated us from God. Jesus Christ
paid the ultimate place of shedding His life to pay the price for our sin. At the cross, we witness both God's profound
love but also the seriousness with which He regards our sin. God doesn't forgive us by turning a blind eye to our sin
or by overlooking it. God being just, had to render justice
([Rom 3:25–26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%203%3A25%E2%80%9326&version=NKJV)) and the price was
the sacrifice of Jesus. **People are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life,
shedding his blood** 

:::tip[Justice, Mercy, Grace]

Justice is getting what you deserve. Mercy is *not* getting what you deserve. Grace is getting the
blessings of what you *don't deserve*.

All three are fulfilled when you accept Jesus and put your faith in Him - He bears your punishment and you get mercy and grace!

:::

[The death of Jesus changes everything!](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-crucifixion.mdx) It is our sincere hope
that each of us comes to understand the profound sacrifice of Jesus Christ. God is real, He loves us
and He desires a relationship with every one of us!

It is only through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross that we who repent are justified before God.

It is only through Christ's resurrection that we have victory over sin, guilt and death.
