# Christianity Claims Certainty While Science Offers Explanations

In the ongoing dialogue between science and religion, a common sentiment is that science explains the *how*, 
while religion speaks to the *why*. But Christianity goes much deeper - it doesn't just offer spiritual guidance
or emotional comfort; it gives certainty about truth, existence, morality, and eternity. In contrast,
science offers tentative explanations, often subject to revision and redefinition. While the scientific method
is a valuable tool for understanding the natural world, it falls short when addressing the deepest questions of
life - Where did we come from? Why are we here? What happens when we die?

These are not minor queries; they shape how we live. Christianity offers answers that are both clear and
unchanging, rooted in the revealed Word of God. Science, especially in its modern secular form, often leaves us
with theories that are evolving, and sometimes self-contradictory. Nowhere is this more evident than in the debate
over evolution vs. creation, morality, and the soul.

## The Problems with Evolution - Adaptation â‰  Origin

The theory of evolution is often presented as a settled fact. We are told that all life forms developed over
billions of years through blind, unguided processes - natural selection and random mutations; however, evolution
has never been observed despite numerous protestations to the contrary. Mutations cannot add the information
necessary to change one kind of organism into another. Natural selection can only choose from what exists - so it
shouldn't take a science degree to understand why molecules-to-man evolution is impossible!

The closer you look at evolution, you find that it fails to explain the origin of life or the diversity of kinds
as it claims. A concept linked with evolution is the Law of Biogenesis, which is a fundamental principle in biology
stating that life only arises from pre-existing life i.e., living organisms can only be produced by other living
organisms, and not from non-living matter. *So while this may work for evolution;* **it cannot explain the
core issue - where did living matter come from to begin with?**

Let us also make a crucial distinction between adaptation within kinds (i.e., *microevolution*) and evolution
across kinds (*macroevolution*). For instance, we see dogs of many breeds, but they are still dogs. Bacteria may
develop resistance to antibiotics, but they remain bacteria. No one has ever observed or documented a genuine
transitional form - an organism that is in the process of changing from one kind to another; but supposedly this
happened with everything around us?

The so-called *missing link* is still missing - and always has been. Perhaps more accurately, we should call it
the *missing think*, because it takes an incredible leap of faith to believe that mindless matter produced
consciousness, morality and meaning. Darwin's theory has been stretched and reinterpreted so many times that
it's hardly recognizable from its original form.

**Scientists admit that the mechanisms of speciation (a process by which new and distinct species are
formed depending on their immediate environment) are unclear, and even proponents of evolution often disagree on
the details.** The fossil record, once hailed as the proof of gradual evolutionary change, is instead marked by
sudden appearances and stasis - i.e., organisms appear fully formed and remain unchanged for millions of years.

Christians affirm that God created each kind of creature according to its kind, just as Genesis describes. **There
is a built in limit to how much change a species can undergo.** *That's not anti-science - that's observable reality.*

## Evolution Offers No Moral Compass

Perhaps the most troubling implication of evolutionary theory is that it leaves no room for absolute morality. If
we are simply the product of chance, natural selection, and chemical processes, then morality becomes nothing more
than a social construct or survival mechanism.

**Without a moral lawgiver, who's to say what is right or wrong?** One culture may condemn murder while another may
justify *honor killings* or oppression. If evolution is true, and survival of the fittest is our guiding principle,
then there is no objective basis for calling anything evil or good. Atheism, rooted in naturalism, cannot provide a
foundation for absolute values, only preferences.

The Christian worldview, by contrast, teaches that we are made in the image of God. That means we have inherent
value, dignity and moral responsibility. God's law is written on our hearts
([Rom 2:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%202%3A15&version=NKJV)), and His commandments
are unchanging. Moral truth doesn't evolve - it reflects the unchanging character of a holy God.

## We Have a Soul - And That Changes Everything

Science can describe the processes of the body, but it cannot explain the origin or essence of the soul.
Consciousness, reason, love and moral awareness are not material - they are spiritual. That's because we
are not merely physical beings; we are body and soul.

The Bible teaches that when God formed Adam, He breathed into him the breath of life
([Gen 2:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gen%202%3A7&version=NKJV)), and man became a
living soul. That soul is what makes us a unique person, gives us identity and eternal value.

If we were simply brain and bone, then death would be the end. But we know instinctively that there is
more beyond the grave. The soul cannot be measured in a laboratory, but its presence is undeniable. And if
we have a soul, then we must ask - **What happens when we die?**

The reality of the soul points to the reality of eternity - either with God or separated from Him.
Every one of us is guilty of sin and in need of redemption. No scientific discovery can change that fact.
Only Jesus Christ, fully God and fully man, lived a sinless life,
[died in our place](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-crucifixion.mdx), and
[rose again](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md) to conquer death. In Him, we have hope,
forgiveness and peace - not just for this life, but for the life to come.

:::tip[Absolute Certainty]

Science may offer explanations for the material world, but only Christ offers certainty about the Eternal One.

## Choose Certainty, Not Speculation

Christianity is not a blind leap into the dark; it is a confident step into the light. It does not waffle
or waver with every new theory or discovery. It proclaims truth with certainty, rooted in the authority of
God's Word and the historical resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Science has its place, and when rightly understood, it confirms the truth of Scripture. But it is not ultimate.
The most important questions of life - Who am I? Why am I here? Where am I going? - can only be answered by the
One who made us.

Don't settle for speculation. Choose certainty. [Choose Christ](../../jesus/because-he-lives/i-can-face-tomorrow.md)
