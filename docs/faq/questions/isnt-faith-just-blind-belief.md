3. Isn’t faith just a crutch for weak people?
Some critics argue that religion is a psychological coping mechanism, invented to comfort people in a harsh world. They suggest that belief in God is not based on truth, but on wishful thinking.

But faith is not blind optimism or emotional dependence. Biblical faith is trust based on evidence. Hebrews 11:1 says, “Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.” It is not belief in the absence of evidence—it is belief in light of the evidence, when that evidence is personal, historical and experiential.

Faith does involve trust—but we all trust something. Every worldview requires a kind of faith. Even atheism requires trust in unseen assumptions about morality, reason and the origin of the universe. The question is not whether we have faith, but whether our faith is well-placed.

Christianity invites people to examine the reasons for belief. From the reliability of Scripture to the testimony of history, from the evidence of creation to the uniqueness of Jesus—there are rational grounds for trusting in God. And far from being a crutch, faith in Christ often leads people to stand with greater courage, not less.
