# Born Without Choice, Yet Doomed for Not Choosing God?

This is a deep and often emotionally charged question. It's one that many people ask at some point
*"I didn't choose to be born. So why am I held accountable for what I do here? And if I don't choose God,
why am I doomed for all eternity?"* For several, this question is less about theology and more about justice
and about what seems fair to them. Underneath it though, lies a moral question - *"Is it right for someone
to be placed in a world they didn't ask to be in, only to face judgment for what they do here?"*

To begin addressing this, we need to look at several key issues: free will, moral accountability,
the nature of rescue and God's provision for salvation.

## Moral Standards and the Problem of Judgment

First, let's look at the underlying moral argument. People ask, *"How can God judge me for not choosing Him,
when I never asked to be born?"* But behind this question is a claim - that God is doing something wrong or
unfair - and that is where the issue of moral standards comes into play.

If you claim something is unjust, you are implying that you know what justice looks like - that you have a
moral standard against which you can measure actions. But here's the challenge - if God doesn't exist, where do
you get that standard? In other words, in order to claim that God is unfair, you must be appealing to a higher
idea of justice. But what is that idea grounded in? Is it your personal preference? Society's norms? Evolutionary
survival instincts? None of these provide a solid, objective basis for morality. Personal preference is highly
subjective. Societal norms change with time and place. Evolution doesn't care about "fairness" - only survival.

However, if God does exist, then He is the moral standard. As the source of life, the creator of the universe
and the author of good, His way is the measure of what is just. If we accuse God of injustice, we're essentially
saying we have a better moral plan than the one who created morality itself. So that raises a second
challenge - If you think God's system is wrong, what would your system look like? And would it stand up under
scrutiny?

## You're Here - Now What?

Let's now turn to the heart of the matter: *"I didn't choose to be here."*

You're absolutely right. **None of us chose to be born.** That's true whether we're created by God, formed by
natural processes of evolution or the result of random cosmic accidents or something else altogether. Whatever
your worldview, one fact is universal - you didn't ask to exist, but here you are!

So the question really isn't, *"Did I choose to be born?"* but *"Now that I'm here, what am I going to do about it?"*

Let's use an analogy. Suppose your parents take you on a boat trip. You didn't choose to go; they simply brought
you along. Then, out of nowhere, the boat starts to sink. Panic sets in. It's scary, chaotic and entirely out
of your control. But just as things seem hopeless, a Coast Guard rescue boat  pulls up beside you, ready to
rescue everyone including you. **Now you have a choice.**

You can sit on the sinking boat yelling, *"I didn't ask to be here! This isn't fair! I shouldn't have to choose!"*.
And you'd be right - you didn't ask for any of it. But the boat is still sinking.

Or, you can step into the rescue boat.

**So what do you choose?**

This is the core of the Christian message. God sees that we are all on the sinking ship of a broken world. We were born
into a system marred by sin, suffering and death. **And God, in His mercy, sends a Savior - Jesus Christ**. He offers rescue.
**Not because we deserve it. Not because we asked for it. But because He loves us.**

So the problem isn't that you didn't choose to be born. The problem is, now that you're here and in trouble, will
you accept the rescue God offers? The choice is yours.

## Free Will and Real Choice

Another important issue is free will. If God forces you to love Him or forces you into heaven, then it's not really
love and it's not really heaven. Love, by nature, must be freely given. Real love involves choice.
The idea that *"I didn't choose to be born, therefore I shouldn't have to choose God"* comes from a misunderstanding of
the kind of relationship God desires with us. He doesn't want robots. He wants children. He wants relationship.
And relationships are built on free will.

:::tip[Free Will]

God gave us all free will. He didn't want robots, He wants children!

In fact, even atheistic or evolutionary worldviews can't escape this reality - once you're alive, you have choices
to make. Whether you think your brain is just neurons firing due to natural selection or that you're a soul given
life by God, either way, you're still faced with decisions and more importantly consequences. 

**So, it's not about how you got here. It's about what you do with what you've been given.**

## The Foundation you can choose to build on

Jesus tells a [powerful parable of Two Builders](../../jesus/life/parables/discipleship.md#wise-and-foolish-builders)
in [Matthew 7:24-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207%3A24-27&version=NKJV).
He says that everyone who hears His words and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.
When the storm came, the house stood strong. But the one who hears His words and doesn't put them into practice is like a
foolish man who built his house on sand. The storm came and the house fell, with a great crash.

What's Jesus saying?

The storms of life - suffering, sin, judgment - are coming for **all** of us. **No one escapes this reality.**
But you have a choice: **what foundation will you build your life on?**

Just like in the analogy of the sinking boat, Jesus is not just describing a problem - He's offering a solution. The offer
is clear - build your life on Him, the solid rock. Not because you chose to be born, not because you earned it, but
because *it's your best and only option.*

## Why Not Take the Rescue?

This brings us to the final and perhaps most challenging, part of the real question - **"If God sends a Savior, why would I reject Him?"**

It's a fair question - and it gets to the heart of human pride. Sometimes people don't want to be rescued. Sometimes it's
because they don't believe they're in danger. Other times it's because they don't want to owe anyone. Or maybe they
think they can save themselves. But the truth is, we can't save ourselves. The Bible says, *"All have sinned and fall
short of the glory of God"* ([Rom 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%203%3A23&version=NKJV)). But it
also says and more importantly, **"The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord"**
([Rom 6:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%206%3A23&version=NKJV)). 

That's the rescue boat. That's the offer. That's the foundation on the rock. 

God doesn't doom people arbitrarily. Nor does He force anyone into salvation.
But in love, [He offers salvation to all](../../jesus/because-he-lives/new-identity-in-christ.mdx).
He sent His Son, not to condemn the world, but to save it
([John 3:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16-17&version=NKJV)).
But He also gives us the freedom to reject Him. **And that's what makes this not a question of fate, but of responsibility!**
God is our loving Father (Eph 3:14-15) and we can part of His family.

The Savior stands in the boat, hand outstretched. *The invitation is real. **The choice is yours.***

And perhaps the correct question here is not, *"Why am I here?"* but *"Now that I am here, what will I do with Jesus?"*
