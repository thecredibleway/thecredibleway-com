# If God Made Everything, What Made God?

At first glance, the question seems logical. We live in a world governed by cause and effect. Everything we
observe has a beginning and an end. Trees grow from seeds, people are born and die, stars are born in nebulas
and eventually burn out. In this universe, everything appears to have a cause. So naturally, if one says God
created everything, it seems fair to ask what caused God.

But this line of reasoning assumes that God is part of the same system as everything else i.e., a system defined
by time, space, matter and the physical laws of these dimensions apply to Him. However, the truth is that 
God is not part of the created order. 

He exists outside it. He is not a creature; He is the Creator.

## God and the Nature of Time

One of the keys to answering this question lies in understanding the nature of time. Time itself is part of God's
creation. [Genesis 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%201%3A1&version=NKJV) reads,
**"In the beginning (time) God created the heavens (space) and the earth (matter) ..."**. *The beginning* refers
not just to physical matter, but to time itself! As human beings, we are bound by time.
We experience it as a linear progression - past, present, and future. Because
of this, we naturally think in terms of beginnings and endings. Everything in our experience seems to be confined
to this dimension. 

But God exists outside of time. He is eternal - not in the sense of simply living for an infinite amount of time,
but in a much more profound and literal sense - He is timeless. He is not bound by the clock or the calendar. This
is why Scripture says in [2 Peter 3:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20pet%203%3A8&version=NKJV),
*"With the Lord, a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day"*. God sees the entire timeline
of history in one unified, eternal *now*. He moves through time as easily as we flip pages in a book i.e., as a reader
we are not subject to the events within the book; but rather observe them from an external perspective. Similarly,
passages like [Matthew 24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024&version=NKJV),
[Luke 21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=lk%2021&version=NKJV) and
[2 Timothy 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Tim%203&version=NKJV) give us glimpses of how God
sees and [speaks of history with perfect clarity](../../bible/credibility/prophecies-fulfilled.md) - they
bear witness of future events, highlight God's foreknowledge
and clearly imply His transcendence over time. *He moves through time as we flip through pages, observing all of
history - **past, present, and future - simultaneously.*** This concept is hard for us to grasp because
we are creatures in time. But once we understand that time itself had a beginning, it becomes clear
that the question, *"Who made God?"* is based on a flawed assumption - that
God must have a beginning because everything else does. That’s simply not the case.

## The Second Law of Thermodynamics and the Universe

From a scientific standpoint, the second law of thermodynamics offers important insight into our universe. This
law states that the amount of usable energy in a closed system will always decrease over time. In other words,
everything is running down. Energy becomes less available for work; disorder increases. This principle applies not 
just to closed systems but also to to the universe itself; which is slowly moving toward a state of death - a bleak
and desolate end.

If the universe had existed forever, it would have already reached this state. But it hasn't. There is still usable
energy i.e., stars still shine, things still move, life continues and so on. This strongly implies that the universe
had a beginning. **Something must have caused it to begin - a cause that itself is not subject to decay and degradation.**
That **"first cause"** must lie outside the system of time and entropy. This is precisely how the Bible describes
God - eternal, uncaused, and not subject to physical laws. The same is also true of all laws that we have. For
example gravity didn't start when Sir Isaac Newton discovered and penned the formula - it existed because a law giver
outside the system of laws created it!

## God Is a Spirit 

Another key aspect to understand is that God is not a material being. He is spirit
([John 4:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%204%3A24&version=NKJV)). While we can see and measure
material objects, spirits are not bound by matter, energy, or time. This is why God cannot be subject to the same rules
that govern the physical universe—like ageing decay, or causality.

The Bible often draws parallels between the *soul* and *life*, often using them as synonyms. Just as our soul gives life
to our bodies and is not material; so too God, the giver of life, exists beyond the physical. Our bodies change and age
with time, but our souls do not. A photo of someone at age 5 looks very different from one at 65. But their soul - their
inner self remains the same, only growing in understanding without growing old in age. 

:::tip[God is the same]

God is a spirit and does not change. He is not subject to entropy, deterioration or death.

:::

Because God is a spirit, the second law of thermodynamics (and all the other physical laws) do not apply to Him.
He is eternal and doesn't need a *first cause*. This is why when Moses asks Him for His name
[Exo 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exo%203&version=NKJV), He replies **"I AM"**. This is not just
a name; it is a declaration of self-existence and eternal being. God doesn’t say, *I was caused* or
*I was created* - He simply is. Unlike everything in the universe that depends on something else for its
existence, God depends on no one and nothing. He is the ultimate foundation of all reality.

## The reality of truth

To ask *"who made God"* is akin to asking, *"What's north of the North Pole?"* It's a question based on
misunderstanding of the very nature of what's being discussed. Rather than trying to fit God into
our limited framework of time and space, we are invited to step back and consider the vastness of who
He is. Not only has He made everything that exists,
but [He invites us to know Him personally](../../jesus/because-he-lives/new-identity-in-christ.mdx),
to experience the reality of His eternal nature, and to dwell with Him beyond time itself.

You have a soul that lives on beyond your physical body for all eternity. To acknowledge God means facing
the [reality of sin and the need for repentance and a saviour in Jesus Christ](../../jesus/because-he-lives/salvation-and-redemption.md).
Jesus Christ paid the ultimate price with His life [so you can be restored to God](../../jesus/because-he-lives/i-can-face-tomorrow.md)

Now you know the truth, what will you do?
