# How Can Christianity Be the Only True Religion?

In today's world, it is not uncommon to encounter a wide array of religions and belief systems.
In fact, society is often marked by the blending of different religious ideas and the push toward
inclusivity. People are left to wonder - how do we decide which path to follow? How can one
religion, Christianity, be the *only true religion* amidst so many competing beliefs?

The answer begins with examining the nature of faith, the credibility of Christianity, and
how it stands apart from other religious systems. It requires looking not just at philosophy
but also at historical evidence and the unique claims made by Jesus Christ. Let's explore
how Christianity can be considered the only true religion in light of evidence, reason and
the human condition.

## Faith is Trust Built on Evidence, Not Blind Belief

One of the first things we must address is a misunderstanding of what *faith* means.
Many sceptics, like Richard Dawkins, define faith as believing in something without evidence.
However, this is a misrepresentation of the term. Faith is not just a religious concept - it
is an ordinary word that refers to trust based on evidence. We trust things in our everyday
lives because we have good reason to do so. For instance, when you go to the bank and take
out a loan, the bank trusts you based on the evidence you provide, like collateral or a credit
history. To believe without evidence is not faith - it's wishful thinking or, in some cases,
blind faith which can be dangerous, as it leads to actions that ignore reason and evidence.

In the Gospel of John, in
[John 20:30-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020%3A30-31&version=NKJV) we
see the basis for faith in Jesus Christ, *"Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his
disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that
Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name."*
John did not simply invent a story; he recorded events that he and others had witnessed. 
These were real historical occurrences that invite us to investigate their truth. Some might
argue that John's writings are biased because they are part of the Bible. However, we must
recognize that John did not know the Bible would be canonized in the way we understand it today,
nor did He know that his letters would be part of the Bible. The truth is however, he was simply
an eyewitness, a real person who experienced historical events, and he recorded those events
so that others might believe. The evidence presented by the New Testament, including the
resurrection of Jesus Christ, stands up to scrutiny and invites honest investigation.

## Comparing the Three Major Religions

Some religions like Buddhism deny the existence of God and focus on enlightenment
by good deeds. There is no hope for the future or any knowledge of how many good deeds are enough.
When comparing Christianity with other major monotheistic religions - Judaism and Islam - it is
important to understand that there are fundamental differences in their understanding of Jesus
Christ, which cannot all be true at once. Jews believe that Jesus died but did not rise from the
dead; Christians believe that Jesus died and rose again; and Muslims believe that Jesus did not
die at all. **These three views are incompatible with one another.**

This difference in beliefs about the central figure of Christianity - Jesus Christ - demands further investigation. The question arises - how can three religions all claim to have the truth about God, yet disagree on the life and resurrection of Jesus? The resolution to this dilemma lies in examining
the evidence that Christianity presents for the resurrection and the implications it has for human
salvation.

## The Key Question - How Is Relationship with God Determined?

Most of the world's religions, whether it's Hinduism, Islam, or Buddhism, offer a system of
merit-based salvation. This means that a person must live a life of good deeds to *earn* 
their way to God, heaven, nirvana, or some other form of ultimate peace. In these systems, when
you die, there is an ultimate judgment where your good works are weighed against your bad works;
i.e. you are accepted at the *end*, if the good outweighs the bad.
The question is - how can anyone be sure they have done enough good to pass the judgment and
be accepted? It is too late to fix it up after you are dead because at that point there are
only consequences with no chance of redemption, for all eternity.

Think of it like this - you go through life as a student in a university, learning from
professors and taking courses. But when it comes time for the final exam, not one of those professors
can guarantee that you will pass. It is up to you alone, with your merits, to secure your future.
Similarly, most religions place the burden of salvation on your own actions, and the result is
uncertainty. 

Christianity, however, is radically different. Christianity teaches that salvation is not based
on merit but on relationship. The relationship with God starts at the very beginning, not at the
end, and the assurance of eternal life is given freely, not earned. Acceptance comes from the
moment you accept Jesus Christ and let Him be your Lord and Saviour. Jesus Christ did not come
to simply teach moral lessons or give us a set of guidelines for how to live; He came to provide
the way for humans to be reconciled with God. The Apostle John writes that *"whoever believes
in Him [Jesus] shall not perish but have eternal life"*
([John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=NKJV)).

Christianity is unique - it does not base salvation on our merits but on God's grace. It
is not about what we have done but about what Jesus Christ has done for us. In a merit based
religion you do good deeds to *earn* forgiveness from God. In Christianity, the good works
Christians do are because they are forgiven by God by the *free* gift of grace. Good deeds
are the fruit of a life already changed by God's love, not the means of earning salvation.
Christians believe that, because Jesus died for their sins, they are already forgiven, 
and their relationship with God is secured. **This assurance is unlike any other religion
or worldview.**

### Testimonies of Atheists and sceptics

Steven Kang who was a devout Buddhist who prayed 8 hours of day and wanted to reach nirvana, he 
instead finds hell and then finds Jesus after a Near Death Experience. [He tells his story and
what led him to Christ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnmUbPouvHk).

Audio recording of a book by Sir Lionel Luckhoo, who was twice knighted by Queen Elizabeth, and
the only person to be Ambassador to two nations for the UK. An expert lawyer who holds the 
Guinness Book of World Records for the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest number
of successive murder acquittals - 245. [He decided to investigate Jesus Christ and became a
Christian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbbMh1MgnyE).

Nabeel Qureshi a medical doctor from Pakistan, was a devout Muslim and wanted to know the truth
after a debate with his friend - [he tells the story of how he sought Allah but found
Jesus Christ instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aqGwE7ZFo0). 

Lee Strobel a stoic atheist and cynic, was a journalist and Legal Editor for the Chicago
Tribune who was close to dying in a coma and had a Near Death Experience. After that he
[went searching for answers and found Jesus Christ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQFXYSTrsqI).

And there are thousands more like this - with personal encounters with the living Jesus Christ.

## Why Christianity's Solution Makes Sense

The problem with all other religions is that they cannot resolve the gap between God's 
holiness and humanity's sinfulness. The idea of merit-based salvation is fundamentally
flawed because no one can ever do enough good works to make themselves righteous before 
a perfectly holy God. If salvation were based on our own works, no one would have any hope.

Buddhism, Islam, and other major religious systems offer philosophical teachings and
moral guidelines. But none offer a solution to the central problem of human existence - how
can we be made right with a perfectly holy God? 
Christianity offers a unique solution - God Himself became human in the person of Jesus
Christ. Jesus lived the perfect life that we could not live, died the death that we
deserved, and rose again to conquer sin and death. This is what Christianity calls
*the atonement* - the reconciliation of humanity with God through Jesus Christ's sacrifice.

:::tip[The old rugged cross]

It is only through the cross of Christ that the problem of human sin can be addressed.

Jesus, as God in human form, bridged the gap between the holy Creator and fallen humanity.

**No other religion or worldview offers this solution.**

## Investigate the Evidence for Yourself

Ultimately, the question of whether Christianity is the only true religion comes down to
the evidence. Christianity does not demand blind faith but invites people to investigate
the historical facts of Jesus Christ's life, [why He came](../../jesus/crediblilty/why-jesus-came.md),
[His teaching](../../jesus/crediblilty/teachings-of-jesus.md),
[death](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-crucifixion.mdx) and
[resurrection](../../jesus/crediblilty/the-resurrection.md). Unlike other religions
that rely on works to gain favour with God, Christianity offers the only solution to the
problem of human sin - a relationship with God made possible through Jesus Christ.

:::tip[The perfect solution]

No other religious figure - whether Buddha, Muhammad, or anyone else - has made such a
claim or offered such a solution for salvation.

Buddha said he was a *seeker of truth*, Muhammed said he was a *prophet of truth*,
Jesus said he **is the truth**

:::

We encourage you to look at the evidence for yourself and have the courage to follow truth,
even if you don't like it - it is still truth. Examine the claims made by each belief system,
and ask yourself which one offers the true solution to humanity's fundamental problem. 
Christianity, through the person of Jesus Christ,
[offers not only the way to eternal life](../../jesus/because-he-lives/new-identity-in-christ.mdx)
but also the assurance of that life, based on a relationship with God rather than our own merit.

So, while many religions claim to be the true path, Christianity stands apart. Its claims 
are rooted in historical events, its solution to human brokenness is unique, and its offer
of salvation is freely given, not earned. The evidence is clear - Christianity is the only
faith that offers a legitimate solution to the problem of sin and the way to eternal life with God.
