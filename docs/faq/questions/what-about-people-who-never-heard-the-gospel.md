# What About People Who Never Heard the Gospel?

The question of what happens to those who never hear the Gospel is one that has weighed heavily on the minds of both
believers and skeptics alike. It touches on issues of divine justice, mercy and the universality of God's salvation
plan. Christianity provides an answer rooted in Scripture while also addressing the heart of the human condition.

At the heart of this discussion is a crucial understanding of God's nature - He is both just and merciful. As the
judge of the universe, God owes no one anything except justice. If He were to solely act in accordance with His
perfect justice, no one could stand before Him, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God
([Rom 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A23&version=NKJV)). The Bible teaches that
the wages of sin is death and this includes eternal separation from God in hell
([Rom 6:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206%3A23&version=NKJV)). The reality
is clear - every person, whether they have heard the Gospel or not, is under the judgment of God because of sin.

Yet, God is not merely a judge who seeks retribution. The Bible reveals that God is also rich in mercy
([Eph 2:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%202%3A4&version=NKJV)) and **in His mercy, He chose
to step down from His heavenly throne to take the penalty for our sins upon Himself.** This was accomplished
through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Jesus is the way, the truth and the life and no one
comes to the Father except through Him
([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2014%3A6&version=NKJV)). But the question
remains - What about those who have never heard the message of Christ? How does this fit into the bigger
picture of God's justice and mercy?

## The Justice of God - Accountability to His Moral Law

The Bible is clear that all people, regardless of their geographical location, race or culture are accountable
to God's moral law. This law is not limited to those who have received the written Scriptures or the message of
the Gospel. According to [Romans 2:12-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%202%3A12-16&version=NKJV),
all people are judged according to the law written on their hearts. The moral law is known through conscience,
and this is true for every human being, whether they live in the heart of Africa, a remote village in the
Amazon rainforest or a bustling city in America.

In [Romans 2:12-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%202%3A12-16&version=NKJV), Paul explains
that *"those who sin without the law will also perish without the law and those who sin under the law will be
judged by the law."* Humanity, in its entirety, is responsible for its actions. The standard of judgment is
God's law and all people - whether they've heard the Gospel or not - are accountable to that law.

[James 2:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jam%202%3A12&version=NKJV) adds to this understanding
by declaring that we will all be judged by the law of liberty, the moral law that reflects God's character.
Those who violate even one of God's commandments come under the same condemnation. Therefore, people who have
not heard the Gospel are still guilty before God because they have violated His moral law in some way.

## The Mercy of God - Opportunity for Repentance

Though the Bible affirms the reality of God's judgment, it also **highlights His overwhelming desire for mercy.
God's ultimate goal is not to condemn, but to save.** In
[2 Peter 3:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Peter%203%3A9&version=NKJV), we read that God is
*"not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."* **This verse reveals God's heart
for all of humanity, including those who may not have heard the message of salvation through Christ.**

So, while the Bible teaches that those who reject God's moral law will face judgment, it also assures us that
God is merciful and gives everyone the opportunity to repent and be saved. The question is - how does God provide
an opportunity for those who have never heard the Gospel?

One possible explanation is the concept of general revelation. In
[Romans 1:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201%3A20&version=NKJV), Paul writes that God
has made Himself known to all people through the created world, *"For since the creation of the world God's
invisible qualities - his eternal power and divine nature - have been clearly seen, being understood from what
has been made, so that people are without excuse."* The natural world, with its complexity and order, points
to a Creator. This revelation, though not enough to lead someone to saving faith in Christ, is enough to make
people aware of God's existence and His power.

It could be that through general revelation, some individuals might be prompted to seek more knowledge about God,
which could lead them to the Gospel. However, it is important to note that the Bible emphasizes that faith in
Christ is necessary for salvation ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jn%2014%3A6&version=NKJV)).
Without the specific knowledge of the Gospel, it is unclear how God will apply the salvation that Christ offers
to those who have never heard it. This remains a theological mystery, one that Christians trust **God will
resolve justly and mercifully because He cannot condemn someone who has no knowledge of the truth.** For example, in
the Old Testament, people that died went to *Paradise* or *Abraham's bosom* which Jesus describes as a place within
eyesight of another place of torment called *Hades*, separated by a *great gulf*.
([Luke 16:19-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016%3A19-31&version=NKJV)). Those people did not
to go to Hades - they never got to hear the Gospel message and hence could not be condemned. When Jesus was on the
cross he told one thief that got saved, that he would join Him in *Paradise*
([Luke 23:43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023%3A43&version=NKJV)). Jesus then died and
went to hell, where He won the victory. On His exit back to heaven; He preached to the people in Paradise to let them choose
([1 Pet 3:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Pet%203%3A19&version=NKJV)) and took those that accepted
the truth to heaven [Eph 4:8-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%204%3A8-10&version=NLT). It says,
*"When he ascended to the heights, He led a crowd of captives and gave gifts to His people."*. **Clearly, showing that
God is a good just God who is also merciful - He sent Jesus for us because He loved us.**

## The Urgency of the Great Commission

As Christians, the reality of eternal judgment should serve as a powerful motivator for evangelism. The apostle
Paul, in [Romans 10:13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2010%3A13-14&version=NKJV), stresses
the importance of preaching the Gospel, *"Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. How, then, can
they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard?
And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?"*

The command to make disciples of all nations is **not merely a suggestion; it is a divine imperative**
([Matt 28:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2028%3A19-20&version=NKJV)). We are called to
actively reach out to the lost, whether they are in our neighborhood or on the other side of the world. The fate
of the lost is serious - eternal life or eternal separation from God is at stake. *It is not enough to sit idly by,
knowing that the message of salvation is available.* Like the
[parable of the Good Samaritan](../../jesus/life/parables/justice-mercy.md#the-good-samaritan)
([Luke 10:25-37](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2010%3A25-37&version=NKJV)), we are to show mercy
to those who are spiritually dying, pleading with them to come to Jesus Christ, the only One who can save them.

The truth of eternal damnation in hell, though uncomfortable, should motivate Christians to compassionately
and urgently share the Gospel. Hell is not just a theological concept - it is a place of real and eternal suffering
([Mark 9:43](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%209%3A43&version=NKJV)). Empathy demands that we
feel the terror of those who face judgment for every human being, whether they live in the heart of Africa,
a remote village in the Amazon rainforest or a bustling city in America. We must act on the compassion we have
for them by sharing the Gospel.

## Trust God's Justice and Mercy

We can be confident that God's justice and mercy are perfectly balanced. His Word has promises and He has never broken
one! He is just and holds all people accountable to His moral law, but He is also merciful and desires that all
come to repentance. This is the reason that Jesus Christ came to save us. In the meantime, we must continue to
reach out with the message of hope, because the Gospel is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes
([Rom 1:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%201%3A16&version=NKJV)).

If you are reading this, you **now** know the gospel message. Jesus came to give you life,
[if you will accept Him](../../jesus/because-he-lives/new-identity-in-christ.mdx). So choose life.
**Where will you spend all of eternity?**
