# Is Jesus Alive

Nearly everyone who has heard of Jesus has formed an opinion about Him. This is not surprising,
as He is the most renowned figure in world history and by far the most debated. What makes Jesus
truly extraordinary is [not solely his teachings](./teachings-of-jesus.md),
though they alone would be enough to set him apart! It is the unique combination of
his teachings and character as a person and the impact on people which are inseparable.

In particular we have :
- The character, miracles and [teachings of Jesus](./teachings-of-jesus.md)
- [More than 350 prophecies that have been fulfilled](./prophecies-fulfilled.md)
- The [empty tomb](./the-resurrection.md#the-empty-tomb)
- [His death and resurrection](./the-resurrection.md) - the foundation of Christian Hope
- [Historical records by the Romans and Syrians](./the-resurrection#roman-historians) - the very people that executed Him.
- [The early church and the spread of the gospel](./the-martyrs.md#the-emergence-of-christianity)
- [The martyrs](./the-martyrs.md) that have given everything up including their lives
  rather than recant their faith


## Where is He now?

After forty days of appearing to His disciples, Jesus ascended into heaven
([Acts 1:9–11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%201%3A9%E2%80%9311&version=NKJV)).
The Bible teaches that He now reigns at the right hand of God the Father, alive in glorified form.
He is not gone or dead but is living in a transcendent, glorified state, interceding for believers
([Rom 8:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%208%3A34&version=NKJV)) and governing His
Church as its risen head ([Col 1:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%201%3A18&version=NKJV)).

Jesus Christ is not a figure confined to the past or to memory. **He is alive and active in the
present, ruling with divine authority and preparing for His eventual return.** At present Jesus is
'the Savior' of the world; but there is a day when he will be 'the Judge' and He will judge the
living and the dead. Though Jesus is not physically present as He was during His earthly ministry, 
He is present in several ways:

#### In the Word

Jesus is the *Word made flesh* ([John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A14&version=NKJV)).
Through the Scriptures, His teachings, life and promises - *'the Word'* is made present to each generation. The Bible
is *'living and active'* ([Heb 4:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204%3A12&version=NKJV)) and
one of the primary ways that Jesus continues to speak and lead people.

#### Through the Holy Spirit

Jesus promised that after His ascension, the Holy Spirit - the *Comforter* or *Advocate* would come
([John 14:16–17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A16%E2%80%9317&version=NKJV)). The Holy Spirit
came to dwell within believers - guiding, convicting and empowering them to live according to God's will. 

#### In the Church

The Church is often described as the *Body of Christ* ([1 Cor 12:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2012%3A27%29&version=NKJV)). Through the community
of believers - it's worship, service, teaching and proclamation - Christ is alive and working in the
world. Many Christians and non Christians experience His presence tangibly in prayer, worship,
and acts of love and service. Many missionaries are classic examples of this - Mother Teresa, Heidi
Baker, Hudson Taylor, John Wesley, Jim Elliot, David Livingstone and many many more.

## Experience the Living Savior

Throughout history, countless believers know and experience Jesus today - it isn't doctrinal, it's real and
deeply experiential. Christians testify to personal encounters with Christ through transformation,
answered prayer, guidance, forgiveness, healing and peace that surpasses understanding. Saints, martyrs,
and ordinary believers alike have drawn strength from an abiding relationship with Jesus.

The fact that Christianity has survived and grown - across centuries, cultures and continents is
evidence of a living, dynamic Lord - He is the same yesterday, today and forever more! Despite
persecution, setbacks and struggles, the faith has endured and transformed lives globally. 
**Because Jesus is alive, His words carry eternal relevance!** His teachings are not ancient wisdom
alone but directives from a living King. It also means accountability, relationship and hope for us!

:::tip[The Resurrection]

The resurrection sets Jesus apart from other religions and leaders! His ongoing life affirms His divinity
and the eternal nature of His Kingdom.

**Because Jesus Christ was resurrected, you and I have hope for today, tomorrow and all eternity!**

:::

**Jesus is alive today!** Not just as a memory, an ideal, or moral teacher, but as the resurrected Son
of God who reigns in heaven and is present through the Holy Spirit. This is reality. Jesus lives in
and through His people, His Church and His continuing mission in the world. 

:::info[The beginning of our story!]

His life offers hope, redemption and the promise of eternal life to all who believe. The resurrection 
was not the end of His story - it was the beginning of ours!

## How Can I Have a Relationship with Jesus Christ?

You can begin a new life in Christ Jesus today! Your life can be changed forever if you repent and
trust the God who made you and loves you. *Many are called, but few are chosen*

:::tip[How will you respond?]

Where will you spend eternity? In heaven or in hell?

:::

**What should I do?**

1. Acknowledge that you have sinned and fallen short of God's standards - repent and tell God that
you now turn from not believing in Jesus and from your sin. Put your faith and trust in
Jesus Christ as your Savior & Lord (someone you obey without hesitation i.e. a full surrender).
Believe that He has heard your request and granted it ([Rom 10:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%2010%3A13&version=NKJV)), as He cannot lie ([Num 23:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Num%2023%3A19&version=NKJV)). Say
out loud that Jesus is your Lord and you believe that He died and God raised Him from the dead and
that your sins are washed by His Blood that was shed for you and me.

2. Read your Bible everyday - speak to God and ask Him what you need to know and obey Him. Take time
to listen to God, not just talk to Him.

3. Ask to be baptized in water. This is to signify a putting away of the old and a clean break between
your old and new life

4. Ask a full-gospel Spirit filled minister about the baptism in the Holy Spirit
