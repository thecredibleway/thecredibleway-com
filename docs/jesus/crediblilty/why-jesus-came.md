# Why Jesus came to the earth

## To Reconcile Us to God (Salvation from Sin)

The primary reason Jesus came was to heal the fractured relationship between humanity and God, a separation caused by sin.
From the very beginning, sin has stood as a barrier - cutting us off from the presence, purpose and peace of God.
It introduced death, shame and spiritual exile into God's perfect world. But God, in His immense love and mercy,
refused to leave us in that state. The Bible says:

:::note[Reconciliation to God]

For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost ([Luke 19:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2019%3A10&version=NKJV))

Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners... ([1 Tim 1:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Tim%201%3A15&version=NKJV))

:::

Jesus entered our broken world not just to teach us about God, but to make a way back to Him. Through His sinless life,
Jesus became the only one qualified to stand in our place. On the cross, He took the punishment you and I deserved -
the substitutionary atonement. His sacrifice satisfied divine justice, offering mercy and grace for us.

:::note[Jesus made to be sin]

God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.
([2 Cor 5:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Cor%205%3A21&version=NKJV))

:::

By dying in our place, Jesus paid the full penalty for sin. His resurrection validated that payment and broke the
power of sin and death. Now, through faith in Him, we are forgiven, justified and welcomed as children into God's
family. Reconciliation isn't just about being pardoned - it's about being restored to the intimate relationship
we were always meant to have with our Creator.

:::tip[This is the heartbeat of the Gospel]

God made a way where there was no way!

:::

Justice is getting what you deserve. Mercy is *not* getting what you deserve. Grace is getting the
blessings of what you *don't deserve*.

All three are fulfilled when you accept Jesus and put your faith in Him - He bears your punishment and you get mercy
and grace!


## To Proclaim and Establish the Kingdom of God

Jesus came not just to offer forgiveness - but to proclaim and establish the reign of God.
At the heart of His message was the declaration that God's Kingdom had broken into the world through Him -
a present spiritual reality with a future global fulfillment.

:::note[The kingdom of God has come near]

The time has come... The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!
([Mark 1:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mk%201%3A15&version=NKJV)) 

:::

[This Kingdom](./teachings-of-jesus.md#the-kingdom-of-god) is not a geographic empire, but the active reign and rule
of God wherever His authority is acknowledged, His will is done and His presence transforms lives.
It begins in hearts and homes and will ultimately encompass all creation.

Jesus' teachings revealed what life in this Kingdom looks like: justice for the oppressed, mercy for the broken,
peace amidst chaos and righteousness that transforms from the inside out. Through His parables, He described
it as a mustard seed ([Mat 13:31-32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A31-32&version=NKJV)) - small but powerful; as yeast ([Mat 13:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A33&version=NKJV)) - quiet but unstoppable; as a hidden treasure ([Mat 13:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2013%3A44&version=NKJV)) - worth sacrificing everything to possess.

His miracles were not just acts of compassion, but signs of the Kingdom's power overturning darkness:
healing the sick, raising the dead, casting out demons and restoring what was lost. Every act of love demonstrated
that His Kingdom takes dominion over evil and begins to reverse the curse of sin.

:::tip[Jesus lived the kingdom of God]

Jesus taught Gospel of the Kingdom, the Authority that Accompanies the Kingdom,
and Union (fellowship and relationship with God) and that **believers would do the same works
as Him and more** ([Mat 28:18-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mat%2028%3A18-20&version=NKJV),
[Mark 16:15-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016%3A15-18&version=NKJV)).
He would send us Holy Spirit, who would be just like Him to live in every one that accepted Him. 

His sacrifice and death on the cross is truly the great exchange - He was scourged and bled for
our healing; He died for our redemption. He exchanged our sin for righteousness,
our sickness for health, our poverty for abundance and our death for eternal life!

:::


But Jesus also spoke of a coming day when this Kingdom would be fully realized - when evil will be utterly defeated,
justice will roll down like waters and God will dwell fully with His people. Until then, He calls us to live as
citizens of heaven on earth, reflecting His reign in our choices, relationships and communities.

In every word and work, Jesus made it clear - **the Kingdom is here and it is worth everything!**

## To Reveal the Character of God

One of the most awe-inspiring reasons Jesus came was to make God known in a way humanity had never seen before.
While the Old Testament gives glimpses of God's nature through laws, prophets and covenants, **Jesus is the full and living
portrait of the invisible God.**

:::note[The image of God]

He is the image of the invisible God...
([Col 1:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Col%201%3A15&version=NKJV))

Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.
([John 14:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A9&version=NKJV))

:::

Jesus didn't just speak about God - He embodied Him. In every word He spoke, every person He healed, every
injustice He confronted and every sinner He forgave, we see the compassion, humility, holiness, mercy and love of God
in action. He showed us a God who weeps with the grieving, dines with the rejected and welcomes the unworthy. A God who
touches the untouchable, restores the outcast and stoops to wash His followers' feet. Jesus' interactions with people -
especially the poor, the broken and the despised-unveiled the tender heart of a Father who longs to be known and near.

By revealing God's character, Jesus cleared away all misconceptions. He showed that God is not distant or disinterested,
but deeply relational, sacrificially loving and fiercely just. To see Jesus is to encounter the very essence of God's
nature - not as a mystery, but as a man who walked among us.

## To Defeat Evil, Death and the Devil

Another vital reason Jesus came was to wage war against evil - and win! His mission was not only to heal hearts,
but to confront the evil that has plagued creation since the Fall.

:::note[Jesus came to destroy the works of the darkness]

The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil
([1 John 3:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203%3A8&version=NKJV))

...that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death - that is, the devil."
([Heb 2:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%202%3A14&version=NKJV))

how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and
healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him
([Acts 10:38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2010%3A38&version=NKJV))

:::

Jesus came to disarm the powers of darkness, to expose and overthrow the dominion of sin, death and the devil.
Through His life, He resisted temptation, cast out demons and brought freedom to the oppressed. On the cross,
it appeared evil had won - but in reality, Christ was triumphing over every force that held humanity captive!

By dying, He robbed death of it's sting. By rising, He shattered the grave's claim. The resurrection isn't just a
sign of new life - it is the victory cry that evil doesn't get the last word.

But Jesus also came to challenge evil in it's earthly forms: corruption, injustice, legalism, religious hypocrisy,
and systems that crush the weak. He was - and is - a threat to every kingdom that opposes God's reign of truth
and grace.

Now, as risen King, Jesus invites you and me to walk in His victory - not in fear, but with courage.
Through Him, the enemy is a defeated foe and death is no longer the end, just a transition to eternal life.

## To Call to Discipleship

Jesus didn't come just to save isolated individuals - He came to call together a new kind of people,
not by ethnicity, class, or culture or the color of their skin - but by a shared commitment to follow Him.

:::note[Jesus came to disciple]

Come, follow me and I will send you out to fish for people. ([Mat 4:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mat%204%3A19&version=NKJV))

Go and make disciples of all nations... ([Mat 28:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mat%2028%3A19&version=NKJV))


:::

His invitation wasn't simply about belief, but about transformation through relationship. To follow Jesus meant
to learn His way of life, to adopt His values and to live under His Lordship. The early disciples certainly weren't
perfect when He called them; but they were willing! And through them, Jesus began a movement that would reach every
corner of the world.

He called fishermen, tax collectors, zealots and outcasts - uniting them into a family of faith that would become
the Church. Today, that same call goes out: not just to believe in Jesus, but to apprentice under Him, to grow in
character, mission and love.

Discipleship is more than attending church - it's a lifelong journey of becoming like Christ and helping others
do the same. Through the global Church, Jesus continues to shape hearts, challenge cultures and extend His
Kingdom in tangible ways.

:::tip[To be a disciple is to say]

Jesus is not only my Savior - He is my Lord, my Teacher, my Leader and the one I will follow with my whole life

:::

## To Fulfill God's Promises

Jesus didn't emerge in history by accident or as an isolated spiritual figure - He is the long anticipated fulfillment
of God's redemptive plan, foretold through the prophets and promised across centuries. His life, death and resurrection
are not only significant events; they are the climax of divine prophecy and the confirmation that God keeps His word.

:::note[Jesus came to fulfill the law, not abolish it]

Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them
([Mat 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mat%205%3A17&version=NKJV))

:::

Throughout the Scriptures, God spoke of a coming Savior - one who would crush the serpent, bless the nations, bear the
sins of many and establish an eternal kingdom. [Jesus fulfilled more than 350 messianic prophecies.](./prophecies-fulfilled#350-prophecies-fulfilled-by-jesus)
By fulfilling the Law and Prophets, Jesus didn't discard the Old Testament - He brought it to life, revealing it's
deeper meaning and perfect purpose. From Abraham to David to Isaiah, every promise finds it's *Yes and Amen* in Him
([2 Cor 1:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Cor%201%3A20&version=NKJV))
His fulfillment of Scripture proves not only that God is sovereign over history, but that His love, patience and purpose
stretch across generations.

Jesus is the thread that weaves together the entire Bible - from Genesis to Revelation - offering hope that is rooted
in history and sealed in eternity.

## In Short

Jesus came to restore humanity's broken relationship with God and to offer forgiveness through His sacrificial death.
He proclaimed the arrival of God's Kingdom, revealed the true character of the Father and overcame the powers of evil,
sin and death. Through His life, He fulfilled ancient prophecies and called people into a new way of living as His
followers. In Jesus, we see God's love in action and His unstoppable plan to redeem the world.
