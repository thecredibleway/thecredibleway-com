# Prophecies Fulfilled

The Old Testament prophecies are like a magnificent tapestry of numerous threads. Each thread
details the life and death of Jesus - put together they reveal Him as the Messiah! 
Even if one discounts the Bible as a fable, it is reasonable to at least approach the Gospels
as historical documents, consider whether they point to Jesus Christ as a credible figure,
and reach an independent conclusion.

This page was not created to win an debate or the like, but with the hope that you honestly
think about life and that you have an encounter with the grace and truth that only God can provide.

Let's start with some probabilities we deal with in everyday life to put this into perspective:
- Being struck by lightning in the USA, [1 in 1,200,000 for an estimated lifespan 80 years](https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-odds).
- Finding a four leaf clover, [1 in 10,000](https://www.udel.edu/faculty-staff/experts/john-frett/).
- Being audited by the IRS, [1 in 220](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/08/attention-taxpayers-irs-audits-have-fallen-significantly.html). *Only two things in life are certain....*  
- and so on

## 8 prophecies fulfilled by Jesus

What are the chances of one person fulfilling just eight ancient prophecies? The statistical odds are staggering.
Now imagine someone fulfilling fifty... or a hundred... or two hundred... It would be mathematically impossible and yet miraculous.
**Yet, Jesus didn't fulfill a mere two hundred prophecies - He fulfilled over three hundred and fifty, written centuries
(many nearly 4000 years) before His birth!**

In [Science Speaks, Peter Stoner](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Speaks-Peter-W-Stoner/dp/0802476309), outlines the mathematical probability of
one person in the 1st century fulfilling just eight of the most clear and straight forward prophecies:

:::info[Science Speaks, Dr. Peter Stoner, Professor Emeritus of Science at Westmont College]

Now these prophecies were either given by inspiration of God or the prophets just wrote them as they thought they should be. In such a case
the prophets had just one chance in 10<sup>17</sup> of having them come true in any man, but they all came true in Christ! **This means that the
fulfillment of these eight prophecies alone proves that God inspired the writing of these prophecies to such absolute definiteness.**

| Old Testament Prophesy | Approximate Date | New Testament Fulfillment	| Probability |
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem [Mic 5:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=%5BMic%205%3A2&version=NKJV) | circa 1804 BC | King Herod asks where Christ was born... and they answered Bethlehem [Mat 2:4-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%202%3A4-6&version=NKJV) | 1 in 280,000 |
| A forerunner of Christ [Mal 3:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mal%203%3A1&version=NKJV) | 450-430 BC | John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ [Mar 1:1-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mar%201%3A1-8&version=NKJV) 	| 1 in 1000 |
| Christ riding on a donkey to enter Jerusalem [Zech 9:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=zech%209%3A9&version=NKJV) | 6th-c BC | Christ enters Jerusalem on an unridden donkey [Mat 21:4-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%2021%3A4-11&version=NKJV) | 1 in 100	|
| Christ betrayed by a friend [Psa 41:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ps%2041%3A9&version=NKJV) | 10th-c BC | Judas betrayed Christ [Luk 22:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luk%2022%3A21&version=NKJV)   	| 1 in 1000	|
| Christ betrayed for 30 pieces of silver [Zech 11:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=zech%2011%3A2&version=NKJV) | 8th-c BC | Judas betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver [Mat 26:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mat%2026%3A15&version=NKJV) | 1 in 1000	|
| 30 pieces of silver cast down to buy a potter's field [Zech 11:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=zech%2011%3A13&version=NKJV) | 8th-c BC	| 30 pieces of silver used to buy a potter's field [Mat 27:3-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%2027%3A3-10&version=NKJV) | 1 in 100,000 |
| Although innocent, Christ was silent when on trial [Isa 53:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isa%2053%3A7&version=NKJV) | 740-700 BC | Jesus Christ kept silent when questioned [Mark 14:60-61](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014%3A60-61&version=NKJV)	| 1 in 1000	|
| Jesus Christ crucified [Psa 22:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ps%2022%3A16&version=NKJV) | 10th-c BC | Jesus Christ was crucified for the sins of the world [John 19:17-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019%3A17-18&version=NKJV) | 1 in 10,000 |

<br/>

How could multiple prophets know what was to happen with such accuracy almost 10 centuries before
Jesus Christ was on the earth? Even taking just the last one of crucifixion - King David wrote that
10 centuries before Jesus was on the earth. Crucifixion wasn't a thing till the Babylonians and
Assyrians started it in the 6th century and the Romans practiced in the 5th century onwards! 

You might even argue that Prof. Stoner's math was wrong, but bear in mind he was Chairman of the
departments of Mathematics and Astronomy at Pasadena City College and then Chairman of the
department of Science at Westmont College, so he knew a thing or two about math!
In fact, H. Harold Hartzler, PhD, of the American Scientific Affiliation, Goshen College, writes
[specifically regarding his calculations](https://sciencespeaks.dstoner.net/#c2):

:::info[On The authenticity of the math - Dr, H. Hartzler, President of the ASA]

The manuscript for Science Speaks has been carefully reviewed by a committee of the American Scientific
Affiliation members and by the Executive Council of the same group and has been found, in general,
to be dependable and accurate in regard to the scientific material presented.

The mathematical analysis included is based upon principles of probability which are thoroughly sound
and Professor Stoner has applied these principles in a proper and convincing way.

:::

## 48 prophecies fulfilled by Jesus

Dr. Stoner went on to calculate the probability of one person fulfilling 48 prophecies to be 1 in
10<sup>157</sup>. Yet the Bible has more than 350 prophesies that have been fulfilled by Jesus Christ
and some to be fulfilled when He returns. I cannot even begin to fathom the numerical value of
that probability...

:::info[The scale of the number of 1 in 10<sup>157</sup>]

Just so you can grasp the magnanimous scale of the prophecies of the coming Messiah, consider these
facts - the size of that number - there are not even that many electrons in the known universe! And
that number is just for 48 of the 350+ known Messianic prophecies that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled. 

**Merely fulfilling 48 of these isn't something that can be explained by random chance. Rather, this
points to a divine origin**

No man could write that book, we call the Bible. The Bible was written by kings, generals, shepherds,
priests, over 1600 years, in 3 languages, on 3 continents, totally 66 books. It was written mostly by
authors who had never met each other, who wrote about controversial subjects and yet all 66 books
agree. **You can absolutely stake your life on it's authenticity, authority and trustworthiness. And
you can and should stake your eternal destiny on it also!**

## 350+ prophecies fulfilled by Jesus

The following is a list of prophecies in the Old Testament that Jesus has fulfilled.

Again, you are encouraged to do your own research and study the Bible for yourself.

:::tip[Only Jesus, the Messiah Jesus could fulfill these]

The probability of one person fulfilling hundreds of ancient prophecies might seem incredibly low
(especially given many are over 15 centuries before Jesus was on the earth). However, the fact that
Jesus fulfilled more than 350 of them is something truly remarkable and mind blowing. This is evidence
of divine purpose and confirmation that Jesus is the Messiah.

It's a powerful reminder that we are finite beings and extraordinary things happen with a God that is
infinite, that go beyond what we might expect or calculate!
