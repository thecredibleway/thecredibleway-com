# The Crucifixion

## Why did Jesus die at the cross?

What would cause Jesus of Nazareth to willingly allow Himself to be whipped, mocked, spat on and then crucified?
The long and the short of it is you and me - more specifically our sin which has separated us from God.

God had to do what He did because He loved us and this was the only way we could have a real relationship with Him - to be called
His children! As human parents, we have occasions where the love for our children wells up with such an intensity that we
simply have to do something for our children. If we as flawed humans can feel this way, imagine what God feels in His perfect
love for us - He couldn't leave us trapped in sin without providing an answer - **He rushes to our rescue because He loves us!**

*God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. ([Rom. 5:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.%205%3A8&version=NKJV))*. Christ's
death leaves no room for doubt about God's love for us. It provides the assurance that, no matter what challenges
life may bring, we can trust in the promise that *He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,
how shall He not with Him also graciously give us all things?" ([Rom. 8:32](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom.%208%3A32&version=NKJV))*

But for some, especially those seeking to understand this sacrifice beyond spiritual terms, a profound question arises 
*Did Jesus truly die on the cross? Was it a real physical death, or could it have been something else - perhaps a
fainting spell or a misdiagnosed survival?* This question isn't merely academic, it strikes at the heart of Christianity
and so it is important to study this from the medical and historical perspective. Can the brutal execution Jesus endured be
examined through the lens of modern medical knowledge? What does the physical evidence - both from ancient accounts and
contemporary forensic analysis, tell us about what happened on that Roman cross?

Let's examine whether the death of Jesus can be verified not just by faith, but by science.

## Did Jesus really die at the cross?

When it comes to this subject, few medical experts can match the
reputation of Dr. Alexander Metherell, M.D., Ph.D. He holds a medical degree from the University of Miami,
Florida and a doctorate in engineering from the University of Bristol, England. Dr. Metherell has conducted
extensive research into the historical, archaeological and medical aspects of the crucifixion of Jesus
of Nazareth. On the medical side, he is certified in diagnostic radiology by the American Board of
Radiology and has served as a consultant for the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a division of
the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. A former research scientist and educator at the University
of California, he has also contributed to leading scientific publications, including Aerospace Medicine
and Scientific American.

### Before the Cross

#### The Garden of Gethsemane

The torture of Jesus Christ began right after the Last Supper, when Jesus and His disciples went to the Garden
of Gethsemane. There Jesus prayed all night knowing what was to come and because of this He naturally was under a
lot of stress to the point that he sweated drops of blood. According to Dr. Metherell, this is a known medical
condition called hematidrosis - a very rare thing but it is associated with a high degree of psychological stress.

:::info[[Dr. Metherell on hematidrosis](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Christ-Journalists-Personal-Investigation/dp/0310350034/)]
What happens is that severe anxiety causes the release of chemicals that break down the capillaries in the sweat
glands. As a result, there's a small amount of bleeding into these glands and the sweat comes out tinged with
blood. What this did was set up the skin to be extremely fragile so that when Jesus was flogged by the Roman
soldier the next day, his skin would be very, very sensitive.
:::

#### Scourging at the Whipping Post

Before Jesus was crucified, He endured one of the most brutal forms of Roman punishment - scourging.
This act of torture was not merely a prelude to execution; it was a horrific ordeal in itself, designed to
physically and psychologically break a person with the intensity depended on the mood of the soldier or his orders.
In the case of Jesus, the Roman governor Pontius Pilate was trying to squelch a riot
([Luke 23:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023%3A22%5D&version=NKJV),
[John 19:4–6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019%3A4%E2%80%936&version=NKJV)) and to appease the
Jews, he wasn't holding back on Jesus! Yet, despite Jesus' mangled appearance, the crowd demanded more
*Crucify Him!* The Gospels give little graphic detail, but historical records and Roman law provide
insight into what Jesus suffered. 

Roman scourging, or flagellation, involved stripping the prisoner and tying him to a post. Soldiers then beat the
victim with a flagrum - a multi-thonged whip embedded with pieces of bone and metal and meant to inflict as much damage
as possible. Each lash tore into the skin, ripping flesh and muscle, sometimes even exposing bone or
internal organs. For Jesus, who had already endured a sleepless night, betrayal, arrest and mockery,
this punishment would have been excruciating. [Isaiah 53:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053%3A5&version=NKJV)
poignantly proclaims, **He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities... and
by His stripes we are healed.** The stripes refer to the lashes He received - taken on behalf of the
world's sin, bearing in His body the punishment due to others.

:::note[[Roman Flagellation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellation)]

Whips were braided leather with small pieces of metal and sharp bone woven were commonly used. Such a device
could easily cause disfigurement and serious trauma, such as ripping pieces of flesh from the body or loss of an eye.
In addition to causing severe pain, the victim would approach a state of hypovolemic shock due to loss of blood.

:::

The backs would be so shredded that at times the spine was left exposed by the deep cuts; and the whipping went
anywhere from the shoulders and back down to the back of the legs! The early church historian (circa 3rd century)
Eusebius wrote **The veins were laid bare and the very muscles, sinews and bowels of the victim were open to exposure.**
Many people would die from this kind of beating even before they could be crucified, as hypovolemic shock sets in.

#### The Crown of Thorns

In addition to this the Romans made Jesus a crown of thorns and shoved that into His head causing further blood loss
and pain. Popular history has the crown being in the shape of a simple circlet; however this is far from the truth. The
actual crown of thorns was more like a cap that went all around his head (similar to the Imperial State Crown of
Great Britain for example).
[The shroud of Turin has fifty holes where the crown was placed on Jesus's head](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365858101_Exegetical_and_Medical_Aspects_of_Jesus'_Death_and_Their_Coherence_with_the_Shroud) - these were 3 inch Bethlehem
thorns.

It is important to note that the crown was made by interweaving (plaiting) the thorn twigs into a **shape of a cap**. This
placed a large number of thorns in contact with the entire top of the head, including the front, back and sides. The blows
from the reed across Jesus' face or against the thorns would have directly irritated the nerves or activated zones along the lip,
side of the nose or face, **bringing severe pain resembling a hot poker or electric shock**. The pain would have lacinated across the
sides of his face or deep into His ears. Bleeding would have resulted in penetrating small red vessels where the pain may have
stopped momentarily only to recur at the slightest movement of the jaw or even the wind. The traumatic shock from the brutal scourging
would have been further enhanced by the paroxysmal pains across the face. Exacerbations and remissions of throbbing bolts of pain
would have occurred all the way to Calvary and during the crucifixion; activated by movements of walking, falling, twisting; from 
the pressure of the thorns against the cross, from the many shoves and blows by the soldiers

:::note[[Hypovolemic Shock - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypovolemic_shock)]
A medical emergency; if left untreated, the insufficient blood flow can cause damage and failure of organs. Consists of the
the heart races to pump blood that isn't there and blood pressure drops causing collapse. The kidneys shut down to prevent
loss of whatever fluid is left and the person is extremely thirsty to replace the lost fluids 
:::

In the accounts of Jesus Christ, He experienced every single one of these - when going up to Golgotha he staggered, fell and
needed help to carry the cross. He cried out and said *'I thirst'* on the cross and was offered vinegar. Dr. Metherell adds **Because of the
terrible effects of this beating, there's no question that Jesus was already in serious to critical condition even before
the nails were driven through his hands and feet**

We also find further evidence that corroborates this account with the Shroud of Turin which bears witness to the extent of
His suffering, the crown of thorns as well as the blood loss.

:::tip[[The hypotheses about the Roman Flagrum - St. Louis Shroud Conference, 2014](https://www.shroud.com/pdfs/stlmanservigipaper.pdf)]

On the imprint of the long Sheet are also clearly visible a number of marks, falling all over the 
surface of the body, from the shoulders to the lower extremities of the legs: scholars interpreted 
those signs like the result of a terrible scourging, which was inflicted on the Man of the Shroud 
before crucifixion. The marks of flogging and crucifixion, like the great part of the wound marks 
visible on the cloth, strengthened the hypothesis of the identification of the Man of the Shroud with 
Jesus of Nazareth: the tortures suffered by the Man of the Shroud can be totally assimilated to the 
ones that, according to the Gospels, were inflicted on Jesus.

#### Beating and Striking

Before His crucifixion, Jesus endured brutal physical abuse at the hands of both the Jewish temple
guards and Roman soldiers. After His arrest in the Garden of Gethsemane, He was brought before the
Sanhedrin where He was blindfolded, mocked and beaten. The Gospels recount that some spat on Him,
slapped Him and struck Him with their fists (
[Mat 26:67–68](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2026%3A67%E2%80%9368&version=NKJV),
[Mark 14:65](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2014%3A65&version=NKJV),
[Luke 22:63–64](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2022%3A63%E2%80%9364&version=NKJV)).
These acts were not only meant to physically injure but also to humiliate and degrade Him. 
He was taunted with phrases like, 'Prophesy to us, Messiah! Who hit you?' - cruel mockery of His divine
role and prophetic gift. Later, under Roman custody, the abuse intensified. The soldiers, known for
their harshness and disdain for those condemned, struck Jesus repeatedly and treated Him with savage cruelty.
He was not just a criminal to them, but a spectacle - a so called 'King of the Jews' to be ridiculed.
[John 19:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019%3A3&version=NKJV) states ***They
struck Him in the face.***

The physical trauma from these beatings likely caused extensive bruising, swelling and bleeding. The
delicate bones of the face, especially the nose, lips and around the eyes would have been vulnerable
to fractures. The pain and disfigurement were part of fulfilling
[Isaiah 52:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2052%3A14&version=NKJV), which says,
***His appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being and His form marred beyond human likeness.***

Jesus bore this suffering voluntarily, absorbing the violence and hatred of humanity to offer peace
and redemption. Every blow was an insult to His identity and mission, yet He endured it in silence -
an image of divine humility and mercy.

#### Carrying the Cross

After enduring flogging, beating and mockery, Jesus was forced to carry His own patibulum (crossbeam) to the place of
execution - Golgotha, or 'the Place of the Skull' ([John 19:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2019%3A17&version=NKJV)).
This journey, known as the Via Dolorosa or *Way of Sorrow* is traditionally believed to be about 2000 feet
(600 metres) through the crowded streets of Jerusalem. But this was no ordinary walk. Jesus, already
weakened and bleeding from the scourging and beatings, now had to carry the heavy wooden beam. As He walked,
His torn and bruised back pressed against the rough wood. Each step was agony - the weight of the patibulum caused
Him to stumble, reopening wounds and adding fresh abrasions to His knees and hands. 

It's easy to imagine the scene - a jeering crowd, soldiers driving Him forward with whips and Jesus
struggling under the crushing burden. At one point, He collapsed from exhaustion. The soldiers, fearing
He might die before reaching the execution site, compelled a bystander - Simon of Cyrene to carry the cross behind Him
([Luke 23:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2023%3A26&version=NKJV)). 

Jesus carries the burden not only of wood, but of sin - the guilt, shame and rebellion of the world. The path to
Golgotha was not just physical but spiritual. Jesus was walking toward His ultimate sacrifice, weighed down by
human suffering and divine purpose. His sacrifice and submission to the Father's will - a love so great for us
that it bore the heaviest burden of all.

### The Cross 

#### The Nails on the Cross

As painful as what this was, Jesus had to endure much much more. The vertical beam would have been set in the ground already
and the cross bar that Jesus was holding would need to be attached to it with Jesus on it. In order to do that He was laid
down over the beam arms out stretched; and the Romans used tapered spikes that were **5 to 7 inches (13-18 cm) long** (see illustration below) and driven into the wrists
to support the weight of the body while hanging.

:::info[[Dr. Metherell on the Patibulum](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Christ-Journalists-Personal-Investigation/dp/0310350034/)]

Paintings show pictures through the palms, that isn't true. It was through the wrists. This was a solid position that would
lock the hand; if the nails had been driven through the palms, his weight would have caused the skin to tear and he would have
fallen off the cross. So the nails went through the wrists, although this was considered part of the hand in the language of the day.
The pain was absolutely unbearable. In fact, it was literally beyond words to describe - ***they had to invent a new word* excruciating**.
Think of that: They needed to create a new word, because there was nothing in the language that could describe the intense
anguish caused during the crucifixion.

At this point Jesus was hoisted as the crossbar was attached to the vertical stake and then nails were driven through Jesus' feet.
Again, the nerves in his feet would have been crushed and there would have been a similar type of pain.

Next comes the intense agony of hanging on the cross itself. 

:::info[[Dr. Metherell on the hanging](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Christ-Journalists-Personal-Investigation/dp/0310350034/)]

First of all, his arms would have immediately been stretched, probably about six inches in length and both shoulders would
have become dislocated - you can determine this with simple mathematical equations. This fulfilled the Old Testament prophecy
in [Psalm 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2022&version=NKJV), **My bones are out of joint** and 
**They pierced My hands and My feet; I can count all My bones.**, which foretold the crucifixion hundreds of years before it took place

:::

### Death Itself

When someone is suspended upright during crucifixion, death comes slowly and painfully, primarily due to suffocation.
This happens because the position places immense strain on the diaphragm and chest muscles, keeping the lungs in a state
similar to inhalation. To exhale, the person must push up with their feet, briefly relieving the muscle tension. However,
this action causes the nail to rip through the foot tissue until it is stopped by the tarsal bones. After exhaling, the body
sinks back down to inhale once more. This cycle of pushing up to breathe and sinking back continues repeatedly, until the person
is so fatigued they can no longer lift themselves to breathe - and eventually, breathing stops entirely.

:::info[Medical Views on the Death by Crucifixion of Jesus Christ - Baylor University Medical Center Proceedings, 2021]

As breathing became increasingly shallow, the individual would enter a state known as respiratory acidosis. In this state,
carbon dioxide accumulates in the bloodstream, combining with water to form carbonic acid, which raises the blood's acidity.
This chemical imbalance disrupts the heart's normal rhythm, leading to arrhythmia, just before succumbing to cardiac arrest.

Additionally, even prior to death, the severe blood loss would have triggered hypovolemic shock, keeping the heart racing
in an effort to maintain circulation. This rapid heart rate would have further strained the cardiovascular system, likely
leading to heart failure. Such a failure can cause fluid to accumulate around the heart (called pericardial effusion) and
in the chest cavity around the lungs (called pleural effusion)

:::

Jesus would have felt his heart faltering, signaling to Him that death was imminent - prompting Him to utter, *Father,
into your hands I commit my spirit* just before He died! 


:::info[[Dr. Metherell on the surety of Jesus being dead](https://www.amazon.com/Case-Christ-Journalists-Personal-Investigation/dp/0310350034/)]

#### Piercing of His Side

The evidence for his death speaks for itself when the Roman soldier came around and, being fairly certain that Jesus was dead,
confirmed it by thrusting a spear into His right side -The spear went through the right lung and into the heart, so when the
spear was pulled out, some fluid i.e the pericardial effusion and the pleural effusion, came out. *This would have the
appearance of a clear fluid, like water, followed by a large volume of blood, as the eyewitness John described in his gospel*

**There was absolutely no doubt that Jesus was dead**

:::

Even modern forensic research such as peer-reviewed medical journals published by the American Medical Association 
confirms that crucifixion leads to death, there can be no doubt!

:::info[[On the Physical Death of Jesus Christ, Journal of AMA 1986;255:1455-1463](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/403315)]
Jesus of Nazareth underwent Jewish and Roman trials, was flogged and was sentenced to death by crucifixion. The scourging produced deep
stripe like lacerations and appreciable blood loss and it set the stage for hypovolemic shock, as evidenced by the fact that Jesus was
too weakened to carry the crossbar (patibulum) to Golgotha. At the site of crucifixion, his wrists were nailed to the patibulum and,
after the patibulum was lifted onto the upright post (stipes), his feet were nailed to the stipes. The major pathophysiological effect
of crucifixion was an interference with normal respirations. Accordingly, death resulted primarily from hypovolemic shock and exhaustion
asphyxia. Jesus' death was ensured by the thrust of a soldier's spear into his side.
Modern medical interpretation of the historical evidence indicates that Jesus was dead when taken down from the cross.

:::

## What Sceptics claim

### Swooning, proven fake

Medical evidence doesn't change with time. All the evidence speaks clearly for itself. **The apostle John had no possible way
of knowing the details but describes the effect exactly as medical science describes the cause of death - almost 2000 years
before we know the human body today!** Jesus couldn't possibly have faked his death, because you can't fake the inability
to breathe for long. The spear thrust into his heart settles the issue once and for all. Besides, the Romans weren't new to
this, nor were they willing to risk their own death by allowing Jesus to just walk away alive. 

:::tip[Jesus crucifixion is absolutely real, beyond the shadow of a doubt]

The only plausible explanation for the numerous independently recorded post-crucifixion appearances of
Jesus and the radical transformation in the disciples' behaviour (from fear to boldness) is that Jesus truly
did what He claimed—supernaturally rose from the dead.

:::

### Substitution, also fake

Others claim that Jesus was substituted on the cross. Sheikh Imran Hosein is an Islamic scholar from Trinidad and Tobago,
who himself [argues against this line of logic and cautions anyone to be careful using this argument] in his book [The Messiah, the Qur'ān and Ākhir al-Zamān](https://imranhosein.org/o/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/The-Messiah-the-Quran-and-Akhir-al-Zaman.pdf) and multiple [videos such as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSmAlRZbJzM) or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYYmAQxjaQc)

:::info[Sheikh Imran Hosein, on the substitution of Jesus on the cross]

For you to come with some red herring that he did something else for which the punishment
was death that's rubbish. Take it and put it in the garbage bin. I don't want to claim to
hate that innocent man who never claimed to be the Messiah was crucified for claiming to be
the Messiah - that's an act of injustice God is not unjust. This theory of substitution
must be rejected by all right-thinking and clear thinking people and we want to
reject it one more time unqualified. This nonsense this act of injustice .... 

and those who hold this view will have to answer to God for it one day. I have to use
this very strong language because there are those who have eyes and yet do not
see and they're heading straight into the fire with this ...

## A Convergence of Faith, History and Medicine

The death of Jesus of Nazareth stands as a pivotal moment in human history, not just theologically,
but also from historical and medical viewpoints. Biblically, His crucifixion is portrayed as the ultimate act of love -
God's answer to humanity's sin - where justice and mercy converge at the cross! The Scriptures affirm that Jesus died
willingly, bearing the weight of our sin to restore our relationship with God.

Historically, Roman crucifixion is well-documented as one of the most excruciating forms of execution. Contemporary
accounts from both biblical sources and Roman historians corroborate the Gospel accounts, indicating Jesus' death
was consistent with the brutal norms of the time.

Medically, modern forensic research such as peer-reviewed medical journal article
[On the Physical Death of Jesus Christ](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/403315), published by
the American Medical Association confirms that crucifixion leads to death by a combination of factors: hypovolemic
shock from blood loss, exhaustion asphyxia and ultimately cardiac arrest. 

**These align precisely with what the Gospel writers recorded - Jesus' inability to carry His cross, the flow of blood
and water from His side and His final cry before death**

Together these three streams - scripture, history and science all converge to affirm not only that Jesus truly died,
but also underscore the profound significance of why He did! The death of Jesus changes everything! 

You now have a choice to make - ultimately if Jesus' death was real, if His resurrection was real;
then everything about Him was real! That also means that there is a God who is real, He loves you and me and desires to have
a relationship with each one of us! 

It is only through Jesus' sacrifice on the cross that we who repent are justified before God. 

It is only through Christ's resurrection that we have victory over sin, guilt and death.
