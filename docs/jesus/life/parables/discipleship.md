# Discipleship and the Cost

Discipleship, according to Jesus, is not a casual commitment or a part-time pursuit. It is a call to a
new way of life - one marked by surrender, sacrifice and intentional obedience. Through His parables and
teachings, Jesus made it clear that following Him comes at a cost, but it also leads to a firm foundation,
lasting purpose and eternal reward. In the Parable of the Tower Builder and the King Going to War, Jesus uses
practical illustrations to emphasize the seriousness of discipleship. No one begins a major endeavor without
counting the cost - and following Christ is no different. These stories challenge us to consider what we're
truly willing to give up to follow Him, because discipleship demands full surrender.

This theme of radical transformation continues in the Parable of the New Wine in Old Wineskins. Jesus teaches
that the new life He brings cannot be contained within the structures of old habits or religious routines.
Discipleship requires not just outward change, but inner renewal - a willingness to let go of the familiar
in order to embrace the fullness of life in Christ. In the Parable of the Unjust Steward, Jesus turns our
attention to how we use our resources. Though the steward is flawed, his shrewdness highlights the need for
intentional, eternity-minded stewardship. As followers of Jesus, we are called to handle money, influence
and time with wisdom, knowing that these temporary things have lasting consequences. The Wise and Foolish
Builders underlines the importance of obedience. True disciples don't just listen to Jesus - they build
their lives on His words. Storms will come, but those who live according to His teaching will stand firm.

Discipleship is costly, but it is also secure, purposeful and eternally rewarding. Jesus doesn't call us
to easy belief, but to wholehearted commitment; and He promises to walk with us every step of the way.

## Wise and Foolish Builders
**Scripture Reference**
[Luke 6:46-49](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206%3A46-49&version=NKJV),
[Matt 7:24-27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207%3A24-27&version=NKJV)

The parable of the Wise and Foolish Builders, is a striking conclusion to Jesus' teaching in the Sermon on
the Mount. It presents two builders - one wise, one foolish; who both construct houses. But the foundation
makes all the difference. The wise man builds on rock, while the foolish one builds on sand. When the
inevitable storm comes, only the house built on the solid foundation remains standing.

This parable is a powerful call to discipleship and it speaks directly to the cost and commitment that true
discipleship requires. Jesus begins by saying, *'Why do you call Me "Lord, Lord," and not do the things which
I say?'* This piercing question reveals that lip service is not enough. To be His disciple means doing what He
says - not just hearing His words, but living them out.

The 'rock' foundation represents obedience to Christ. The wise builder not only hears Jesus' words but puts
them into practice. This is the heart of discipleship - not mere belief, but transformed living. Following
Jesus involves building every part of our lives - our decisions, relationships, values and priorities - on His
teaching. That kind of life takes effort, sacrifice and intention. It is costly because it demands submission,
humility and perseverance, especially when His commands challenge our comfort or confront our culture.
In contrast, the foolish builder represents someone who hears but does not obey. His foundation on 'sand' is
weak because it's based on appearance rather than substance. A house on sand might look fine in good weather,
but storms reveal its true condition. This illustrates the danger of superficial faith - Christianity in name
only. Discipleship without obedience is ultimately unstable and cannot withstand the pressures of life or the
judgment of God.

The cost of discipleship is high, but the reward is enduring. **Jesus doesn't say the wise builder will avoid
storms** - both builders face the same storm. *But the house on the rock stands firm*. Likewise, faithful
disciples will face trials, suffering and hardship. But those whose lives are deeply rooted in Christ will
endure, finding strength and peace even when life shakes around them. This parable also touches on stewardship,
particularly the stewardship of our response to God's Word. We are each responsible for how we hear and act on
the teachings of Jesus. To build wisely is to take that responsibility seriously - to invest our lives in what
truly lasts. In the end, this parable is an invitation and a warning. Jesus is not looking for fans or casual
admirers, but for committed followers who will build their lives on Him, no matter the cost. Discipleship is not
just about hearing His words but doing them - even when it's hard, even when it costs us. Because only what is
built on the rock will stand.

The heart of discipleship is not just mere belief or lip service, but transformed living. Following
Jesus involves building every part of our lives - our decisions, relationships, values and priorities - on His
teaching. That kind of life takes effort, sacrifice and intention.

The storms of life come alike, but only those with a firm foundation whose lives are deeply rooted in
Christ will endure, finding strength and peace even when life shakes around them.

## The Tower Builder
**Scripture Reference** 
[Luke 14:28-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2014%3A28-30&version=NKJV)

This a brief but powerful teaching from Jesus about the cost of discipleship. He asks, *'Which of you, intending
to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost?'* The image is simple - a man begins to build
but doesn't finish because he didn't calculate whether he had enough resources. The result is public embarrassment
and failure - a half-built tower that becomes a monument to poor planning. Jesus uses this image to highlight a
crucial truth - following Him requires thoughtful, deliberate commitment. Discipleship is not a spontaneous decision
made in an emotional moment. It is a life-long journey that demands full surrender and ongoing faithfulness. Like
the builder in the parable, anyone who wishes to follow Christ must first consider what it will cost - and whether
they're truly willing to see it through.

The context of this parable is important. Just before this, Jesus says that anyone who wants to follow Him must
*hate* their own family and even their own life - meaning that loyalty to Christ must take precedence over every
other attachment or identity. That's a heavy demand and Jesus wants no one to follow Him under false pretenses.

This parable challenges us to examine the depth of our faith. Are we truly committed to Christ or are we only
willing to follow when it's easy or convenient? The call to discipleship is not a call to comfort, but to sacrifice.
It may cost us relationships, ambitions, reputation or security. But Jesus says half-hearted faith will
not endure. At the same time, the parable is not meant to scare us away, but to encourage honest reflection and
intentional faith. Just as a builder prepares for the full scope of a project, we are called to prepare our hearts
and lives for the full reality of following Christ.

:::tip[Following Jesus requires thoughtful commitment and a willingness to see it through]

Jesus doesn't want unfinished towers or lukewarm disciples - He wants followers who are all in. Those who count
the cost and still say yes are the ones who will see the work completed and the foundation hold.

Do I count the cost of discipleship and commit fully, knowing that half-hearted faith won't stand the test? Do I
choose to take up my cross every day and follow Jesus?

## The King Going to War 
**Scripture Reference** 
[Luke 14:28-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2014%3A31-33&version=NKJV)

The parable of The King Going to War, continues Jesus' teaching on the cost of discipleship. He paints the
picture of a king who considers going to battle against another king; but before charging ahead, he wisely
evaluates whether he has the strength to win. If not, he seeks terms of peace. Jesus then draws the connection
clearly: *'So likewise, whoever of you does not forsake all that he has cannot be My disciple'*.

This parable underscores that **true discipleship is not casual - it demands complete surrender**. Just as a
king must assess his position and make a costly strategic decision, anyone who desires to follow Christ must
soberly evaluate what it will take. Following Jesus means laying aside not just our possessions, but our desires,
ambitions and plans - even our perceived 'rights' - to live under His rule. In this light, the parable is not
simply about avoiding defeat; it's about recognizing our weakness and choosing peace with the true King - Jesus
Himself. To 'go to war' against Christ by insisting on our own way, our own authority, is ultimately a losing
battle. The wise choice is to surrender to Him in humility and trust. In doing so, we are not giving up true
life - we are gaining it.

This parable pairs naturally with the one before it - the Tower Builder - and they form a powerful call to
intentional, all-in discipleship. Where the first urges us to count the cost, this one calls us to accept it.
There is no room for divided loyalty. Jesus doesn't invite us to a half-committed faith, but to a life wholly
surrendered to His lordship. This parable invites us to lay down our own kingdoms and trust the King who
has already won the victory. Only through surrender can we walk in the fullness of life that Jesus offers.

:::tip[True discipleship demands surrendering everything, even our own desires and plans]

Jesus doesn't invite us to a half-committed faith, but to a life wholly surrendered to His lordship.
*'Whoever of you does not forsake all that he has cannot be My disciple'*. This means nothing can be more
important than Christ - not wealth, not status, not personal plans... He must be our highest allegiance.

Do I daily lay down my own agenda to follow Christ, trusting His victory over all?

## New Wine in Old Wineskins
**Scripture Reference** 
[Luke 5:36-39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%205%3A36-39&version=NKJV),
[Matt 9:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%209%3A16-17&version=NKJV),
[Mark 2:21-22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202%3A21%E2%80%9322&version=NKJV)

This parable uses vivid imagery to convey a central truth about Jesus' ministry - the new life He brings
cannot be contained within old systems, structures or mindsets. Jesus compares His teaching and Kingdom work to
new wine, which, if poured into old wineskins, will burst them - ruining both the wine and the skins. Instead,
new wine must be put into new wineskins.

In ancient times, wineskins - made from animal hides were used to ferment wine. Freshly pressed grape juice
(new wine) would continue to expand as it fermented. Old wineskins, having already stretched and hardened
from previous use, lacked the flexibility to accommodate this expansion. **New realities require new containers**.

Jesus told this parable in response to criticism from religious leaders who were questioning why His disciples
didn't fast like the Pharisees or follow traditional patterns. His answer reveals that His coming marks a
radical shift. *He didn't come to patch up the old religious system or merely reform external behaviors*. **He came
to usher in an entirely new covenant, centered not on ritual but on relationship, not on legalism but on grace and
transformation**.

This parable speaks directly to spiritual renewal and the need for personal openness to change. To receive the
life Jesus offers, we must be willing to let go of rigid mindsets, outdated traditions or old habits that resist
the work of the Spirit. Just as new wine needs flexible wineskins, spiritual renewal requires a heart that is soft,
humble and ready to grow. It also challenges us in discipleship. True followers of Jesus must continually make space
for God to do something new in their lives. Clinging to 'the way things have always been' whether in our personal
habits, culture or faith practices - can prevent us from experiencing the fullness of Christ's transforming power.

:::tip[New Life needs New Containers]

The new life Jesus brings can't be confined by old ways of thinking or living. 

The parable ends with a warning, *'No one, having drunk old wine, immediately desires new; for he says, "The old
is better"'*. Change may be hard and we may be tempted to prefer the comfort of the familiar.

**But Jesus calls us beyond comfort - into a new way of living, shaped by the Spirit and filled with His life!**

Have I let go of outdated habits that resist God's work in me? Is my heart open to the new life in Jesus
and power of Holy Spirit?

## The Unjust Steward
**Scripture Reference** 
[Luke 16:1-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016%3A1-13&version=NKJV)

In the parable, a steward (or manager) is caught mismanaging his master's goods and is about to be fired.
Knowing he'll soon be out of a job, he acts quickly - reducing the debts of his master's clients in hopes of
securing future favors from them. When the master hears about it, he doesn't condone the steward's dishonesty,
but he commends his shrewdness - his clever use of a bad situation to plan ahead. This parable is one of
Jesus' most surprising and thought-provoking teachings. At first, it seems strange that Jesus would use a
dishonest manager as an example - but the key lies in understanding the lesson He draws from the story -
discipleship involves wise, intentional stewardship of all we've been given, especially our worldly resources.

Jesus uses this unexpected turn to make a deeper point, *'The sons of this world are more shrewd in their
generation than the sons of light'*. In other words, worldly people often show more foresight and creativity
in managing temporary things than God's people do with eternal ones. As disciples, we are called to be both
faithful and wise in how we handle money, time, influence and opportunity - not for selfish gain, but for
God's kingdom.

**Discipleship means recognizing that everything we have is on loan from God. *We are stewards, not owners***.
And just as the steward in the parable had to give an account, so will we. That makes how we use our resources
a deeply spiritual matter. Jesus says, *'If you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit
to your trust the true riches?'* This links material faithfulness to spiritual responsibility. This parable also
reveals a powerful truth - worldly wealth has eternal potential. Jesus challenges His followers to use money in
a way that makes a difference in eternity, *'make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon, that when you fail,
they may receive you into everlasting habitations'*. **This points to using resources to bless others and advance
the gospel, resulting in eternal impact**.

Finally, Jesus ends with a sobering statement, ***'You cannot serve God and mammon'***. Discipleship demands
ultimate loyalty. Money is a tool, but it must never become a master. True followers of Jesus see their wealth - not
as an end — but as a means to serve God's purposes.

:::tip[Temporary resources that have eternal implications]

Jesus invites us to live with eternal priorities, purposeful generosity and faithful stewardship - because
how we handle temporary things reveals who we truly serve. Use worldly resources wisely and faithfully, recognizing
they are temporary but have eternal implications.

Do I handle money and possessions as a steward for God's purposes, not just for personal gain? Who am I serving - 
God or myself?
