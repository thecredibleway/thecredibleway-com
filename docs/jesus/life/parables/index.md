# The Parables of Jesus

In three years of public ministry, Jesus's words transformed humanity and challenged conventional wisdom. He demonstrated
servant leadership and called on His followers to demonstrate a radical love to build God's kingdom on earth. Jesus often
taught in parables - *short, relatable stories that illustrate profound spiritual truths*. He used this method for several
reasons, including making his teachings memorable and accessible to a wide audience while also revealing deeper meanings
to those who were receptive. For those with hardened hearts or a lack of genuine desire to understand, the parables served
to obscure the truth, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies.
