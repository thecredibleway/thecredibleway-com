# Salvation and Redemption

## The Cost of Redemption

Redemption means "to buy back" or "to pay the ransom for freedom". Humanity was enslaved to sin, cursed by the law,
and cut off from Godâ€™s presence. But Jesus, the spotless Lamb, gave Himself to redeem us.
[Ephesians 1:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%201%3A7&version=NKJV) says 
*"In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace"*

:::tip[The Cost of Redemption]

His sacrifice was not symbolic - it was substitutionary.

He took what we deserved so we could receive what He deserved. 

:::

On the cross, our sin was exchanged for His righteousness, our punishment was exchanged for His peace,
our shame was exchanged for His acceptance - because He loves us. This is the *Great Exchange of the Gospel*.

## Freedom from sin and death

At the heart of the Christian message is salvation - the breathtaking reality of being reconciled to God
and set free from the grip of sin and death. 
Paul boldly declares in [Rom 6:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%206%3A14&version=NKJV)
*"For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law but under grace"*. 

The cross didn't just forgive our sin - it broke sin's power. We are no longer sinners trying to do better;
we are redeemed children of God made righteous by His blood.

This salvation isn't earned by good behavior, religious rituals, philosophical wisdom or intellectual striving.
It rests entirely on one person: Jesus Christ. Jesus made a bold and exclusive statement in **I am the way, the truth and the life. No one
comes to the Father except through Me** ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A6%29&version=NKJV)).
There is no God but Jehovah and the only way to God is through Jesus - there is no middle ground.
Salvation as an exclusive relationship with the living God through Jesus Christ.

You have to ask yourself honestly - if a man can be beaten, whipped, crucified, buried, put in a tomb,
supernaturally raised to life and be seen by more than 400 eye witnesses, is that credible enough?
In fact the Romans - the very people that put Him to death, testify of his resurrection and
the spread of Christianity! The disciples, who once fled in fear, were transformed into bold proclaimers
of the resurrection and were willing to suffer and die rather than deny what they had seen.

Muhammad, Buddha, Confucius, Joseph Smith were all sinners as well; and needed a sinless person to pay
for their sins too, they could never take your place. Only Jesus was without sin, only He could take your place.
No other person - not Muhammad, not Buddha, not Confucius, not Joseph Smith - rose from the dead. While these
leaders offered teachings, none offered themselves as a living sacrifice for humanity's sin - for you and for me.
They didn't take our place - only Jesus loved you enough to suffer and die for your sins and sickness,
nor did they pay the price to restore your back to relationship with God! Not only that, but

:::tip[Truth]

Buddha said he was a *seeker of truth*, Muhammed said he was a *prophet of truth*,
Jesus said he **is the truth**!

Because Jesus is credible, then what He said is also credible! I have to believe what He says. **It
is no longer about my personal opinion.** 

Buddha and Muhammed (& everyone else) are all sinners as well and need a sinless person
to pay for their sins too - they could never take your place. Only Jesus was without sin, only
He could take your place.

This is a radical departure from all other philosophies. Jesus is truth and invites you to have a relationship
with God.

Now the question becomes personal: Do you believe Him? Will you follow Him? Will you follow truth?
