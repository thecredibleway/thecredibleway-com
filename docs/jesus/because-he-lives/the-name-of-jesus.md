# The Name of Jesus 

In every culture, names carry meaning. But in Scripture, names hold power. A name isn't just a
label - it represented nature, authority and identity. Nowhere is this more evident than in the
name of Jesus. To the casual observer, *Jesus* may seem like just another religious figure, but
the reality is the name of Jesus is a fountain of life, a banner of victory and a strong tower of safety.

:::tip[Because Jesus lives...]

His name is not a relic of the past, but a living source of power, promise and presence.

It is the name above every name - given, exalted and honored by God Himself!

:::

## What's in a Name

The name *Jesus* comes from the Hebrew *Yeshua*, meaning **Yahweh saves** or **The Lord is salvation**.
This was not by co-incidence. The angel instructed Joseph before Jesus' birth 
***You shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins***
([Mat 1:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%201%3A21&version=NKJV)).
Jesus did not name Himself. The name was given from heaven, confirming its divine significance. 

His very name declares His mission - to save. Unlike other leaders or teachers, Jesus didn't simply
come to inspire - **He came to rescue**  

On earth, a title may be obtained through *inheritance*, as with royalty; through *conquest*, as with an
invading king; or by *conferral*, such as in the case of a knighthood
([The Name of Jesus, Kenneth E. Hagin](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0892765399); 
[The Wonderful Name of Jesus, E. W. Kenyon](https://www.amazon.com/Wonderful-Name-Jesus-W-Kenyon/dp/1641236736)).

Jesus got His name via **inheritance** - 
[Acts 13:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%2013%3A33&version=NKJV) says *You are My
Son, Today I have begotten You*. When Jesus, (the Word), took our place on the cross, He gave up His Spirit and God
resurrected Him - the first born from the dead. ([Heb 1:1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=heb%201%3A1-4&version=NKJV), [John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%201%3A14&version=NKJV))
When Jesus defeated the enemy by **conquest**, God gave Him a name above everything
[Col 2:14-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%202%3A14-15&version=NKJV). In
[Phil 2:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=phil%202%3A9-10&version=NKJV), Paul writes
*Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that
at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven and of those on earth and of those under the earth*
And lastly, Jesus also got His name by **conferral**. [Eph 1:17-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%201%3A17-23&version=NKJV) says *...and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all
principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this
age but also in that which is to come.* **Jesus Christ is the only person in all of history to get
His name and title by all three methods!**

:::tip[The name of Jesus]

God gave Him the name - not just *Jesus* but the full title and honor that comes with it - Lord, Christ, Son of God, King of Kings!

:::

## The Authority in His Name

When Jesus walked the earth, demons trembled at His presence. After His resurrection, that
power was conferred to those who believe in Him - **through His name**

*And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons*
([Mark 16:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016%3A17&version=NKJV)).

The name of Jesus breaks spiritual oppression. It is not a formula but the divine
authority in His name. When spoken in faith, the name of Jesus releases heaven's
power against the works of darkness.

When Jesus ascended to heaven, He gave us the Great Commission - the right and 
responsibility of every believer - to stand against the enemy, by the authority
in His name!

:::tip[The Great Commission]

Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptized will be saved;
but he who does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they
will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; 18 they will take up serpents; and if they drink
anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick and they will recover.
[Mark 16:15-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%2016%3A15-18&version=NKJV)

All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always,
even to the end of the age.
[Mat 28:18-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%2028%3A18-20&version=NKJV)

:::

## Healing in His Name

Peter and John believed Jesus and when they encountered a crippled man at the
temple gate, they said, *In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk*
([Acts 3:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%203%3A6&version=NKJV)).
The man jumped to his feet, healed by the authority of
that name.

Healing didn't come from Peter's holiness or eloquence - it came from Jesus' living
name, applied in faith.

## Prayer in His Name

Jesus taught His disciples, *If you ask anything in My name, I will do it*
([John 14:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A14%5D&version=NKJV)).
To pray *in Jesus' name* is not a ritual phrase. It means to ask according to His
will, in His authority and on the basis of His finished work.

His name gives us access to the Father - because Jesus lives, our prayers have power!

## Protection in His Name

[Proverbs 18:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs%2018%3A10&version=NKJV)
says *The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run into it and are safe.*

The name of Jesus is not just for offense but defense. In spiritual warfare, in fear, in
temptation - the name of Jesus is a refuge. It carries the weight of His character and the
weight of the authority behind His name.

Christians throughout history have testified to the power of calling on Jesus in crisis.
Whether whispered in a hospital room or cried out in a car accident, the name of Jesus
has brought peace, intervention and miraculous outcomes - Jesus Christ is the same
yesterday, today and forever
([Heb 13:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%2013%3A8&version=NKJV)).

Because Jesus lives, His name is not a distant relic - it's a present help in trouble!

## The Identity in His Name

When we become Christians, we are identified with Christ. We are baptized in His name.
We are called by His name. 

*If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed...*
([1 Pet 4:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Pet%204%3A14&version=NKJV))

To carry the name of Jesus is an honor. It means we represent Him in the world. His name
is stamped on our hearts, marking us as His own. Our identity is rooted in His! Because
Jesus lives, our identity is secure. 

:::tip[Our Identity in Jesus Christ]
We are not defined by failure, culture or past sin - we are defined by the one whose name we bear:

We are children of God through Jesus.

We are co-heirs with Christ.

We are ambassadors in His name.

His name reshapes ours. It changes our destiny.

:::

## The Worship of His Name

Paul writes in [Phil 2:9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=phil%202%3A9-11&version=NKJV), 
*Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that
at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven and of those on earth and of those
under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord ...*

The name of Jesus is worthy of worship in heaven and earth. Even now, angels and saints proclaim His
worth. Every healing, every salvation, every answered prayer is a reason to worship that name. 
We worship not just because of what Jesus did, but because He still lives. His name carries
glory - that's why early Christians (as well as today) have suffered and died for His
name - they knew it was not just history, but eternal reality!

When we say, *Thank You, Jesus,* we aren't just recalling a good teacher; we're addressing a
living King.

## The Name in Daily Life

The name of Jesus is not just for church or crisis, it's for everyday life:

Speak His name when you wake up: *Jesus, guide me today.*

Whisper His name when tempted: *Jesus, help me overcome.*

Call on His name in gratitude: *Thank You, Jesus, for this moment.*

His name invites Him into every moment. It centers our hearts and brings peace.

[Col 3:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%203%3A17&version=NKJV)
exhorts us all *And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the
name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him*

:::info[The Name of Jesus in Daily Life]

It means living life with integrity, humility and dependence on Him.

To live in Jesus' name is to live like Him, with Him and for Him

:::

Because He lives, we can live differently - marked by His name in how we love,
serve and shine.

## The Boldness of the Name

The book of Acts is filled with the bold use of Jesus' name. The apostles were beaten and
forbidden to speak it - but they rejoiced, *They never stopped teaching and proclaiming the
good news that Jesus is the Messiah.*
([Acts 5:42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%205%3A42&version=NKJV))

Why? Because they knew the name they preached belonged to the resurrected Lord,
and that no power could stop Him! We are called to the same boldness - Speak His name
without shame. Declare His name over your family. Share His name with your neighbors.
Trust in His name in the face of fear.

The name of Jesus is your anchor and weapon - because Jesus lives, you never walk alone!

## The Final Victory in His Name

The Revelation of JEsus Christ reveals that Jesus will return with a name written on
Him that no one knows but Himself
([Rev 19:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2019%3A12&version=NKJV)) - a
mysterious testimony to the infinite depth of who He is.

He is called Faithful and True, the Word of God, the Prince of Peace, the Lamb of God,
the Resurrection and the Life, the Way, the Truth and the Life and the King of Kings!
The armies of heaven follow Him. Why? Because His name guarantees victory.
We don't just begin in His name - we end in it.

We are saved in His name. We are kept in His name. We will be raised in His name. As
believers, we live in a story authored, sustained and completed by Jesus.

Because He lives, we live in the power of His name - now and forever!

## Jesus, Name Above All Names

Whether you are a new believer or have walked with Christ for years, don't let the
name of Jesus become ordinary. His name is your inheritance, your authority, your comfort
and your worship.

Call on His name. Trust in His name. Live for His name.

Because Jesus lives, His name lives in you!
