# New Identity in Christ

The New Birth is a radical transformation - a spiritual rebirth - by which a person is not merely improved or reformed, but
made entirely new. This is not simply a metaphor for moral change or a fresh start in life. Rather, the new birth is a divine
act of God, by which He imparts His very own life into the soul of a person, fundamentally altering their identity,
destiny and relationship with Him.

## The Conversation with Nicodemus

The most direct teaching on the new birth comes from Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus in
[John 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%203&version=NKJV).
Nicodemus was a respected religious leader, who comes to Jesus by night, seeking to understand His teachings. Jesus
surprises him by declaring, *Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom
of God [John 3:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%203&version=NKJV).* Nicodemus, confused, asks how a
grown man can be born a second time. Jesus clarifies that this new birth is not physical, but spiritual:
*Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit
[John 3:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%203&version=NKJV).*

:::info[[John 3:1-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%203&version=NKJV)]

There was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.

This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, **"Rabbi, we know that You are a teacher come from God; for no
one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him."**

Jesus answered and said to him, "**Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom
of God."**

Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb
and be born?"

Jesus answered, **"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the
kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.** Do not
marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.' The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it,
but cannot tell where it comes from and where it goes. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."

Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"

Jesus answered and said to him, "Are you the teacher of Israel and do not know these things? Most assuredly, I say
to you, We speak what We know and testify what We have seen and you do not receive Our witness. If I have told you
earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? 13 No one has ascended
to heaven but He who came down from heaven, that is, the Son of Man who is in heaven. And as Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not perish
but have eternal life.

**For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but
have everlasting life.**

**For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.
"He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not
believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God"**

:::

Humans are complex because we are made in the image and likeness of God
([Gen 1:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A26&version=NKJV))! We are spirit, soul and
body. The new birth, is a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit, bringing forth new life from above. Only God's Spirit
can bring a dead (not physically dead, but separated from God) spirit to life. When you are born again your
spirit (the real you) isn't healed, it's created anew and infused with the Spirit of God Himself!

## What Is the New Birth

The new birth is the beginning. It is not about becoming religious or joining a church; it is about receiving
a new nature. The apostle Paul describes this transformation with vivid language: **Therefore, if anyone is in
Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new**
([2 Cor 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205%3A17&version=NKJV)).

To be born again means that God's Spirit enters your spirit or heart - breaking the power of sin, awakening faith,
and igniting love for God. The new birth is not earned or deserved; it is a free gift, received by faith. As the
apostle John writes **But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who
believe in His name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of
God** ([John 1:12-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A12-13&version=NKJV)).

## The Nature of the New Birth

#### A Work of God's Spirit

The new birth is not a self-help project. *Jesus said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which
is born of the Spirit is spirit" ([John 3:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A6&version=NKJV))*.
Only God's Spirit can bring a dead heart to life.

#### A New Identity

Through the new birth, we become *children of God*. [Our past does not define us - God's grace does](./grace-and-empowerment.md).
We are adopted into His family, loved, accepted and secure!

#### A New Heart and Mind
*God promises "I will give you a new heart and a new spirit I will put within you".
([Ezek 36:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2036%3A26%2C&version=NKJV))*. The new birth
brings a change in our desires, attitudes and affections. We begin to love what God loves and hate what He hates -
a full 180 degree transformation.

#### A New Power Over Sin

The bondage of sin is broken. Though Christians are not yet perfect, the power of the old nature is decisively defeated. 
We are empowered by the Holy Spirit to live in victory and obedience.

#### A New Destiny
Eternal life begins at the moment of new birth. It is not simply a future hope, but a present reality. *Jesus said,
"Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life and shall
not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life."
([John 5:24](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%205%3A24&version=NKJV))*.

## How Does the New Birth Happen?

The new birth is the sovereign work of God, but He invites us to respond. The Gospel calls us to repent and
believe - to turn from sin and trust in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. When we do, God's Spirit works within us,
imparting new life. It is important to realize that the new birth is not a result of human effort or religious ceremony.
No one can make themselves born again any more than a child can cause their own birth. It is entirely the work of
God's grace and yet He works through our faith in Christ.

#### What should I do to be saved?

1. Acknowledge that you have sinned and fallen short of God's standards - repent and tell God that
you now turn from not believing in Jesus and from your sin. Put your faith and trust in
Jesus Christ as your Saviour & Lord (someone you obey without hesitation i.e. a full surrender).
Believe that He has heard your request and granted it ([Rom 10:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%2010%3A13&version=NKJV)), as He cannot lie ([Num 23:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Num%2023%3A19&version=NKJV)). Say
out loud that Jesus is your Lord and you believe that He died and God raised Him from the dead and
that your sins are washed by His Blood that was shed for you and me.

2. Read your Bible everyday - speak to God and ask Him what you need to know and obey Him. Take time
to listen to God, not just talk to Him.

3. Ask to be baptized in water. This is to signify a putting away of the old and a clean break between
your old and new life

4. Ask a full-gospel Spirit filled minister about the baptism in the Holy Spirit

#### Evidence of the New Birth

How does a person know they have been born again? Much like in the natural, we know an apple tree is an
apple tree by the fruit it bears, so it is with being born again - you bear the fruit of Jesus Christ!
The Bible points to several signs:

- A growing likeness to Christ in character and actions
- A new love for God and His Word
- A desire to obey God and turn from sin
- A love for other believers
- An inner witness of the Holy Spirit, assuring us of God's love
- A desire to share the gospel, to heal the sick and cast out darkness - this is fulfilling the Great Commission of Jesus

These are not the cause of new birth, but the fruit of it - signs that God's life is at work within us.

## Living Out the New Birth

The new birth is not the end, but the beginning of the Christian journey. Just as a newborn grows and matures,
so believers are called to grow in grace, knowledge and Christlikeness. The Holy Spirit continues to work in us,
transforming us. The new birth provides an unshakeable foundation. We are no longer slaves to fear or sin, but
beloved sons and daughters. The same Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead lives in us, empowering us to walk in
newness of life ([Rom 8:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%208%3A11&version=NKJV))

:::tip[You must be born again]

Jesus' words to Nicodemus are universal: **"You must be born again"**
([John 3:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%203&version=NKJV)).

**No amount of religion, morality, or good intentions are enough!**

The problem of sin goes too deep for human solutions. We need a new heart, a new nature, a new life - and this
is what Christ offers.

:::

The new birth in Christ is a profound gift to be valued. It is the miracle of spiritual resurrection - going from
darkness to light, from death to life, from alienation to intimacy with God. All who come to Christ in repentance
and faith can experience this transformation, becoming new creations, beloved children, heirs of eternal life.
Through the new birth, we enter into the fullness of God's love and purpose, beginning a journey that lasts for eternity.

The invitation is open to all: **If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold,
all things have become new**
([2 Cor 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%205%3A17&version=NKJV))

You now have to make a personal choice - what will you do?
