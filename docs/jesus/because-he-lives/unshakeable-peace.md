# Peace that Passes Understanding

In a world filled with anxiety, turmoil and uncertainty, peace often feels like a fleeting illusion. Whether 
it's fear of death, failure, rejection or the future, fear can dominate the human heart. But Jesus Christ offers
something entirely different - a supernatural, unshakable peace that passes understanding. 
Jesus said *Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be
troubled, neither let it be afraid* ([John 14:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A27&version=NKJV)).
This isn't a shallow peace dependent on circumstances. It's divine peace - His peace, offered freely to every believer
through the finished work of the cross.

## Peace Is a Person
At the core of the Gospel is not just a concept of peace - it's the revelation of Jesus as the Prince of Peace
([Isa 9:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isa%209%3A6&version=NKJV)). Peace is not something
He gives separately from Himself; it is something He is!

When Jesus reconciled us to the Father, He removed the enmity that once existed between us and God.
[Romans 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205%3A1&version=NKJV) says
*"Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ"*.

Before Christ, we were enemies of God, estranged by sin. But now, we are at peace with God — legally,
relationally and eternally.


## Freedom from Fear, Worry and Anxiety

Fear is one of the enemy's greatest tools. It paralyzes, distorts truth and robs people of joy. But through Jesus,
we are set free from fear because He has conquered death – the greatest fear of all. His resurrection assures us
that death is not the end, but the beginning of eternal life! He said *and lo, I am with you always, even to the
end of the age* ([Mat 28:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%2028%3A20&version=NKJV)). You are never alone!
He gives us authority over darkness *For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind*
([2 Tim 1:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20tim%201%3A7&version=NKJV)). *He has made peace with God for us*
([Rom 5:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%205%3A1&version=NKJV))

Jesus never promised a life without storms. But He promised peace in the midst of them. The storm didn’t unsettle
Jesus because peace was already inside Him. What He carried, He released. As followers of Christ, we are called
to do the same. He gives us authority to use and speak to the storms of life as He did. 
It is the assurance that no matter what we face, we are secure in His love and protected by His grace.

No Jesus, no peace.

Know Jesus, know peace.

Peace is not the absence of trouble - it is the presence of Jesus in the trouble!

## Guarding and Growing in Peace

Peace can be challenged, but it can also be protected and cultivated.

#### Guard Your Heart

[Colossians 3:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians%203%3A15&version=NKJV)
says *"Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts"*.

Let it rule - not fear, not anxiety, not anger. When peace starts to slip, you can stop and ask,
"What am I letting rule my heart right now?" 

#### Stay in Prayer

[Philippians 4:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204%3A6&version=NKJV)
says *"Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer... let your requests be made known to God"*. 

Peace comes when we stop carrying what was never ours to carry. Prayer transfers the burden to God.

#### Meditate on Truth

[Philippians 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%204%3A8&version=NKJV)
says *"Whatever is true, noble, just... meditate on these things"*.

Your thought life directly impacts your peace. Feed your mind with truth, not fear. Stay grounded
in the Word, not the world.

## Jesus, Our Anchor of Peace

When we invite Jesus into our lives, we don't receive calm or positivity; we receive peace itself!
Unlike philosophies that encourage escape or detachment, Jesus empowers us to overcome the world through His peace: *In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world* ([John 16:33](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016%3A33&version=NKJV)). Fear no longer dominates. Worry no longer drives our decisions. Anxiety no longer
owns our future. **The peace of Jesus transforms how we think, live and move through life**.

Paul reminds us in ([Phil 4:6–7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Phil%204%3A6%E2%80%937&version=NKJV))
that God's peace, is beyond understanding and guards our hearts and minds when we trust Him. It's not born of denial,
but of surrender to God's steadfast faithfulness. Peace isn't found in the absence of trouble, but in the presence of
Christ. True freedom from fear comes not by striving, but by trusting. *You will keep him in perfect peace,
whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You* ([Isa 26:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2026%3A3&version=NKJV))

**Do you long for peace that remains even in the storm?** *Come to Jesus*. He is not offering religion or a
self-help formula

He is offering Himself! And in Him, you will find a peace that fear cannot touch!
