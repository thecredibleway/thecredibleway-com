# Healing

## Freedom from Sickness, Disease and Pain

Many people recognize the cross as the place where sins were forgiven and rightly so. But the atonement of Christ encompasses more than just
the forgiveness of sin - it includes the healing of our bodies. The suffering of Jesus wasn't just physical agony; it was a divine exchange in
which our brokenness - spirit, soul and body - was laid upon Him so that we might be made whole. Through the cross, Jesus brings freedom from
sickness and the restoration of health to all who believe!

:::tip[Isaiah 53:4-5 (prophetically speaking of Jesus) declares]

Surely He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows;
Yet we esteemed Him stricken, Smitten by God and afflicted.

But He was **wounded for our transgressions**,
He was **bruised for our iniquities**;
The chastisement for our peace was upon Him,
**And by His stripes we are healed**

:::

The Hebrew word translated as *griefs* ([H2483](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h2483/kjv/wlc/0-1/) in the Strong's) means
**sicknesses** and **diseases**. The word *sorrows* ([H4341](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4341/kjv/wlc/0-1/) in the Strong's) means
**pains (physical and mental)**. 

Jesus bore more than our sins - ***He carried our physical and mental suffering as well.***

The healing Jesus offers is not merely symbolic. It is real, redemptive and rooted in the very work of the cross. 
The apostle Peter affirms this in the New Testament

:::tip[1 Peter 2:24]

who Himself **bore our sins in His own body on the tree**, that we, *having died to sins, might live for righteousness* **by whose stripes you were healed**.

:::

Throughout His earthly ministry, Jesus was constantly healing the sick. From lepers to the blind, the lame to the demon-oppressed;
healing was a central sign of His Kingdom. He did it because it  reveals the compassion and character of God.

:::info[Jesus healed]

And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching ..., preaching the gospel of the kingdom and *healing **all** kinds of
sickness **and** all kinds of disease* among the people
([Mat 4:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%204%3A23&version=NKJV))

Then Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching ..., preaching the gospel of the kingdom and *healing
**every** sickness and **every** disease among the people*
([Mat 9:35](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%209%3A35&version=NKJV))

So Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes. And immediately their eyes received sight and they followed Him
([Mat 20:34](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%2020%3A34&version=NKJV))

And the whole multitude sought to touch Him, for power went out from Him and healed them all
([Luke 6:19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=lk%206%3A19&version=NKJV))

:::

Healing is not just what Jesus did - it is who He is. His compassion for the hurting flows directly from the heart
of the Father! **And that compassion didn't end at the resurrection - it continues today and is freely available to you!**
The Jesus who healed in Galilee is the same Jesus who heals today. The cross was a complete work. When Jesus declared,
**It is finished** He wasn't just referring to the payment for sin; He was also declaring the defeat of death, sickness
and all forms of bondage. His body was broken so yours could be made whole. 

Healing is not something we have to earn or strive for - it is a free gift of grace, received by faith. Just as we trust
Him for salvation, we can trust Him for healing. Jesus said * And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father
may be glorified in the Son.* ([John 14:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A13&version=NKJV)). Also confirmed by
*And the prayer of faith will save the sick and the Lord will raise him up* ([James 5:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=james%205%3A15&version=NKJV))

:::tip[Hebrews 13:8]

Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever ([Heb 13:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%2013%3A8&version=NKJV))

If He healed then, He heals now!

## More Than Physical: Healing for the Whole Person

Physical healing is indeed a vital part of Jesus' ministry, a powerful sign that God's kingdom has broken into our world.
Yet, to focus solely on the physical is to overlook the deeper and broader work that Jesus came to accomplish. Jesus heals
the body, but His compassion and power reach far beyond flesh and bone. **He offers healing for the whole person - spirit,
soul (mind, will and emotions) and body.**

:::tip[Total Healing for the Whole Person]

Jesus came not just to cure symptoms, but to restore the entire person - 
to bring shalom (peace, wholeness, well-being) to every part of your life

:::

Humans are complex because we are made in the image and likeness of God
([Gen 1:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A26&version=NKJV)). We are spirit, soul and body. 
Pain can settle into any or all of these areas. Wounds aren't always visible; many people carry scars that cannot be seen
with the naked eye - broken hearts, anxious minds, shattered identities or spirit's weighed down by guilt and shame.
In the Gospels, Jesus does not only lay hands on bodies; He speaks peace to troubled hearts, lifts condemnation from outcasts,
and restores dignity to the shamed. He welcomes the weary and offers rest, brings clarity to the confused,
and sets captives free from fear and darkness.

:::info[Total Healing for the Whole Person]

```js title="Luke 4:18"
The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,
Because He has anointed Me
To preach the gospel to the poor;
He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted,
To proclaim liberty to the captives
And recovery of sight to the blind,
To set at liberty those who are oppressed;
```

```js title="Psalm 103:2-6"
Bless the Lord, O my soul,
And forget not all His benefits:
Who forgives all your iniquities,
Who heals all your diseases,
Who redeems your life from destruction,
Who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies,
Who satisfies your mouth with good things,
So that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.
The Lord executes righteousness
And justice for all who are oppressed.
```
:::

Jesus' healing is holistic. The Hebrew concept of *shalom* encapsulates this idea - it's not just the absence of pain -
but the presence of peace, wholeness and well-being. When Jesus heals, He aims to restore a person fully, reconnecting
them to God, to others and even to themselves by giving them identity in Him. He addresses the roots, not just the
symptoms. Emotional wounds, mental torment and spiritual oppression are **all** met with the power of His love and the
authority of His name. The invitation Jesus extends is for more than mere physical temporary relief. *The thief does not
come except to steal and to kill and to destroy, but I have come that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly* ([John 10:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2010%3A10&version=NKJV)). His touch binds
up the brokenhearted, renewing minds and lifts spirits. Through Him, true and lasting wholeness is possible. 

**Freedom from sickness is not a distant hope - it is a present reality for those who believe in the finished work of
Christ. The healing you long for was already purchased - you just need to receive it in Jesus' name by faith.**

Are you sick in body? Weary in mind? Broken in heart? Come to Jesus.
