# I Can Face Tomorrow

## What If Jesus Hadn't Come?

Have you ever paused to truly consider what our lives and our eternal destinies would look like
if Jesus had never come to die on the cross? It's a question that strips away surface level religion
and forces us to grapple with the core of our faith. Without Christ's sacrifice, humanity would
still be burdened by sin, separated from God and without the hope of redemption. **But because Jesus
came, everything has changed!**

In today's world, it's easy to lose sight of this reality. Surrounded by denominations, church
traditions and cultural Christianity, it's vital to clarify what we believe and where we
place our trust. Our faith is not in Christianity as an institution, nor in churches, leaders,
or personal passion. It is not ideology; nor is it anchored in how passionately we
worship, how much doctrine we know, or how many church services we attend. **Our faith
is in Jesus Christ alone** - the one who lived, died and rose again. 

Our hope is not rooted in our sincerity, which can waver, or in our feelings, which fluctuate.
It is anchored in the unchanging credibility of the One we believe in. Jesus is trustworthy.
[Jesus Christ is extremely credible](../crediblilty/is-jesus-alive.md) and can therefore be taken at His Word!

:::tip[Because Jesus came...]

The story of our lives is no longer defined by sin, shame, or separation. It's now marked by grace,
renewal and resurrection power!

What does the cross mean for you and me today?

- It means [reconciliation with God is possible](./salvation-and-redemption.md) - we are no longer orphans or strangers, but beloved children with hope.
- It means we have the [Holy Spirit](./the-holy-spirit.md) - the same person and power that raised Christ from the dead.
- It means we have a [new identity](./new-identity-in-christ.mdx) - restored relationship with God.
- It means we have the [Name of Jesus](./the-name-of-jesus.md) and [authority](./authority-of-the-believer.md) - over the enemy.
- It means we have [access to grace](./grace-and-empowerment.md) - a power that not only saves us but transforms us.
- It means we have [healing](./healing.mdx) - from every sickness or disease.
- It means we have [peace](./unshakeable-peace.md) - from everything the world throws at us - fear, worry, anxiety....
- It means we have [abundance](./provision-and-abundance.md) - to fulfill God's calling, bless others and establish His kingdom on earth.
- And it means **Jesus is present with us today - not as a distant figure in history, but as the risen King who walks with us, speaks to us and leads us in truth.**

## God has plan for you

The Bible offers profound assurance that God has a personal plan for each individual, marked by
purpose, hope and loving guidance. Scripture emphasizes that you are not an accident, but rather
intentionally created and deeply known by God. 

:::note[[Jer 29:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2029%3A11&version=NKJV)]

For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to
give you a future and a hope.

:::

This verse reflects God's desire not just for general good, but for your specific wellbeing and destiny. Throughout Scripture,
we see a recurring theme: God is involved in the details of your life.
[Psa 139:13-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psa%20139%3A13-18&version=NKJV) says *"God formed you in the womb, knows your
thoughts and has written every day of your life in His book"*.
[Eph 2:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph%202%3A10&version=NKJV) adds that *"we are His workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus for good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do."* This reveals a divine purpose tailored for your life - work,
relationships and service that bring fulfillment and align with God's kingdom.

God's plan isn't always easy or clear in the moment, but the Bible promises He is always working for your good
([Rom 8:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%208%3A28&version=NKJV)), even through trials. His desire is for
you to trust Him, grow in faith and walk in the identity He has given you. 

Ultimately, God's plan for you is [rooted in a relationship with Him](./new-identity-in-christ.mdx), one that shapes your present and secures your eternal future!
