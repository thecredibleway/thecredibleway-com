# Who is Jesus Christ

Nearly everyone who has heard of Jesus has formed an opinion about Him. This is not surprising,
as He is the most renowned figure in world history and by far the most debated. Jaroslav
Pelikan, Sterling Professor Emeritus of History at Yale University writes in his book
[Jesus Through the Centuries: His Place in the History of Culture](https://www.amazon.com/Jesus-Through-Centuries-History-Culture/dp/0300079877)

Regardless of what anyone may personally think or believe about Him, Jesus of Nazareth has been the
dominant figure in the history of western culture for almost twenty centuries.

What makes Jesus truly extraordinary is [not solely his teachings](./crediblilty/teachings-of-jesus.md),
though they alone would be enough to set him apart! It is the unique combination of
his [teachings, character as a person](./crediblilty/teachings-of-jesus.md) and the
[impact on people](./crediblilty/the-martyrs.md), which are inseparable.

Is Jesus an imposter or is Jesus the truth?

:::

## Is He an Imposter?

If Jesus knew he was not God, then he was lying. If he was a imposter then he was also a
hypocrite because he told others to be honest, whatever the cost. He urged people to abandon
their own religious beliefs and place their trust in him for their eternal destiny. If Jesus
knowingly made false claims, it would lead us to the conclusion that he was profoundly immoral. 

But most importantly if Jesus had been lying, He would also have been a fool, because his claims
to deity led to his crucifixion (John 19:7) and caused him to suffer in the most painful way
before He died.

How, in the name of logic, common sense and experience, could an impostor - that is a
deceitful, selfish, depraved man - have invented and consistently maintained from beginning to
end, the purest and noblest character known in history with the most perfect air of truth
and reality? 

How could He have conceived and successfully carried out a plan of unparalleled beneficence,
moral magnitude and sublimity and sacrificed his own life for it, in the face of the strongest
prejudices of his people and age?

:::

Jesus had multiple opportunities to take advantage of people around him, yet didn't. He was not
looking for power - quite the opposite; He modeled serving others
([John 13:1â€“16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2013%3A1%E2%80%9316&version=NKJV);
[15:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A13&version=NKJV)) and
giving without expecting anything in return, even to the wicked and ungrateful
([Luke 6:35-36](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%206%3A35-36&version=NKJV)).
He was not seeking glory for himself - He willingly came to be a servant and to suffer and die
on the cross for you and me ([Phil 2:5-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians%202%3A5-8&version=NKJV)).

Based on what we know of Him through scripture, through eyewitness accounts, through history,
through the lives of his disciples; Jesus was not motivated to lie about his identity for any
reason!  *If Jesus was not an imposter, then what's the alternative?*

## Is He Lord?

If Jesus of Nazareth is not an imposter, then He must be Lord. He must be the way, the truth
and the life.

```js 
Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." (Mat 16:13-20)

[Martha] said to Him, "Yes, Lord; I believe You are the Christ, the Son of God ..." (John 11:27)

Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!" (John 20:28) 

The Roman centurion "Lord, I am not worthy..." (Mat 8:8)

and so on 
```

**Other self-proclaimed gods and saviors have come and gone, but Jesus Christ, stands
head-and-shoulders above them all; and He is still alive!** The evidence is in favor of Jesus as Lord,
embodying truth and love! The consistency of [His teachings](./crediblilty/teachings-of-jesus.md),
the [fulfillment of prophecies](./crediblilty/prophecies-fulfilled.md) and the transformative power of
[His life, death and resurrection](./crediblilty/is-jesus-alive.md). Jesus openly declared
His divine identity, performed miracles and lived a life of perfect integrity, aligning
His actions with His words, that left such an [impact on His followers](./crediblilty/the-martyrs.md)

The apostle John wrote, "these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the
Son of God and that believing you may have life in His name" ([John 20:31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020%3A30-31&version=NKJV)).

## Is Jesus Credible?

One of the things Jesus Christ said that remains controversial to this day was **I am the way,
the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me ([John 14:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014%3A6&version=NKJV)).** The only
way to God is through Jesus; there is no God but Jehovah. 

We've established Jesus wasn't an imposter, so the next question then is whether Jesus was credible.
If Jesus is credible, then the scriptures are credible and there is only one God i.e. Jehovah. Jesus Christ
[fulfilled more than 350 prophesies when He was on the earth](./crediblilty/prophecies-fulfilled.md) -
the odds of one person doing this is incalculable, yet they've been fulfilled! This is evidence
of divine purpose and confirmation that Jesus is the Messiah. If Jesus is credible there aren't
multiple pathways to heaven, just Him! You have to ask yourself honestly - if a man can be crucified,
buried, put in a tomb, supernaturally raised to life and be seen by more than 500 eye witnesses
is that credible enough? Muhammad, Buddha, Confucius, Joseph Smith etc were great leaders but they never
rose from the dead. They never loved you enough to suffer and die for your sins and sickness,
nor did they pay the price to restore your back to relationship with God - only Jesus Christ did!

:::tip[Truth]

Buddha said he was a *seeker of truth*, Muhammed said he was a *prophet of truth*,
Jesus said **He is the truth**!

:::

If Jesus is credible, then what He said is also credible! I have to believe what He says. *It
is no longer about my personal opinion.* There is only one God - Jehovah, who has revealed Himself
through scripture, through His Son Jesus Christ.

:::tip[The question stands before you today]

Is He truth and if so do you know Jesus personally - is He truth to you?
