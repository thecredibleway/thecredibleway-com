# Survival and Resiliency

The Bible is the most widely read and distributed book in human history, has also been the most attacked,
banned and burned. From emperors and kings to religious institutions and ideological regimes, efforts to
suppress the Scriptures have spanned over two millennia.

:::tip[The Bible lives]

Yet, against every attempt to silence it, the Bible has endured, surviving censorship, fire and fierce
opposition; emerging not only intact but thriving and more widely available than ever before; continuing to
shape hearts, lives and minds of people all across the globe.

## Roman Persecution and Imperial Decrees

The earliest persecutions of the Bible came during the Roman Empire. Christians, who revered the Scriptures
as sacred, were considered a threat to Roman religious and political unity. As Christianity spread in the
first few centuries after Christ, Roman authorities saw it as subversive and sought to stamp it out.

The most intense campaigns occurred under Emperor Diocletian, in 303 AD, when he issued a series of edicts
ordering the destruction of churches, burning of sacred Scriptures and imprisonment of Christian leaders.
**Diocletian's goal was to erase Christianity from memory and the Bible, as it's foundation, was a central
target.** Christians caught with Scriptures were executed and entire libraries of biblical manuscripts
were destroyed. Yet, many believers risked their lives to preserve copies, hiding them in walls, caves
and underground catacombs.

Ironically, just a few decades later, under Emperor Constantine, Christianity was legalized and the Bible
began to be publicly copied and read throughout the empire.

## Medieval Suppression and Latin Monopoly

During the Middle Ages, the Bible was largely confined to Latin translations, specifically the Vulgate,
translated by Jerome in the 4th century. While this version served the Catholic church well, it became a tool for
restricting access to Scripture when literacy was low and clergy held exclusive interpretive power.

From the 12th century onward, attempts to translate the Bible into common languages were met with severe
resistance. Church authorities feared that common people might misinterpret the text or challenge the
Church and this led to a series of prohibitions:
- In 1229, the Council of Toulouse forbade laypeople from possessing non Latin Bibles.
- In 1408, the Constitutions of Oxford banned English translations of the Bible without Church approval.

## Wycliffe, Tyndale and the Price of Translation

One of the earliest reformers to challenge this control was John Wycliffe (1320 - 1384 AD), who translated
the Bible into Middle English from the Latin Vulgate. Although his translation was completed before the
printing press, it circulated in handwritten copies. Wycliffe died of natural causes in 1384 AD. 
However, his teachings were later condemned and in 1428 AD; many years after his death his remains were
exhumed, burned and the ashes scattered into a river as a form of posthumous punishment.

Later, William Tyndale (1494-1536 AD) took Wycliffe's vision further. He translated the Bible from the
original Hebrew and Greek into English, aiming to make it available to every common person. His famous declaration:

:::info[William Tyndale]

I will cause a boy that driveth the plough to know more of the Scripture than thou [the clergy] dost.

:::

For his efforts, Tyndale was hunted, betrayed and eventually strangled and burned at the stake in 1536 AD.
His final words were, **"Lord, open the King of England's eyes."** 

*Astonishingly, within a few years,
English Bibles were being printed with royal permission - many of them heavily based on Tyndale's own
translation.*

## The Counter-Reformation and the Council of Trent

In response to the Protestant Reformation, the Catholic Church took strong measures to regain control over
Scripture. One of these was the establishment of the Index of Forbidden Books - a list of texts, including
many Protestant Bibles, that Catholics were forbidden to read.

The Council of Trent (1545-1563 AD) affirmed the Latin Vulgate as the official Bible of the Catholic Church
and strictly regulated the production and interpretation of Scripture. Unauthorized translations and personal
interpretations were viewed with suspicion and often suppressed.

Despite this, underground Bible reading and distribution continued, especially in regions like Spain and Italy
where Protestant ideas were spreading covertly.

## The Bible Under Totalitarian Regimes

The 20th century witnessed new forms of Bible persecution under communist and fascist regimes, where the Bible
was seen as a threat to political ideology.

#### Soviet Union

Under Stalin's USSR, the Bible was considered a tool of Western influence and religious superstition. Churches
were closed, religious leaders imprisoned or executed and Bibles were banned. Owning a Bible could result in
harsh punishment or exile to Siberian labor camps. Despite this, underground churches flourished and smuggled
Bibles circulated secretly among believers.

#### Nazi Germany

The Nazis attempted to **rewrite the Bible to remove Jewish elements and references to love and mercy that
conflicted with their ideology.** They supported the creation of a *German Christian Bible* devoid of the Old
Testament and altered references to Jesus' Jewish heritage. True believers resisted, preserving and preaching
the unaltered Scriptures even under threat and were sentenced to concentration camps and then executed.

#### Communist China

In modern China, the Bible is still heavily regulated. The government allows only state approved translations
and tightly controls online and print distribution. Unregistered churches (house churches) often operate in
secrecy and foreign missionaries or Bible smugglers have faced arrest and deportation. Yet, China has one
of the fastest growing Christian populations and demand for Bibles remains incredibly high.


## Smuggling and Underground Distribution

Efforts to smuggle Bibles into restricted nations have been ongoing for centuries. Organizations like Open Doors
and Brother Andrew's **God's Smuggler** movement gained notoriety in the 20th century for delivering Bibles behind
the Iron Curtain. These modern day missions have continued to provide access to Scripture in North Korea, Iran,
India, Saudi Arabia and other nations where Christianity is outlawed or severely restricted.

Smugglers use creative methods, from hiding Bibles in shipments and cars to using digital tools like encrypted
apps and audio players disguised as everyday items.

## The Digital Age and Continued Censorship

Today, the Bible is more accessible than ever thanks to digital platforms. Apps like YouVersion, websites like
BibleGateway and thousands of online ministries make it possible to read, search and share Scripture from
almost any device.

However, censorship remains. Some countries block Bible websites, remove religious apps from app stores, or
monitor online religious activity. In places like North Korea, even owning a Bible is punishable by death,
and Christians often memorize Scripture in secret to avoid detection.

## Criticism in the Intellectual World

Beyond physical persecution, the Bible has also faced intellectual attacks, particularly from the Enlightenment period
onward. Thinkers during the 17th - 21st centuries questioned the Bible's credibility, authorship and relevance. Yet
despite these criticisms, it continues to be respected and studied seriously across academic fields. Critics have repeatedly
declared the Bible obsolete - but it continues to thrive. No other book has been examined so intensely - every line, chapter,
and idea has been challenged - but it still stands.

:::info[[Protestant Christian Evidences, Prof. B. Ramm,](https://www.amazon.com/Protestant-Christian-Evidences-Bernard-Rahm/dp/B000NL2HV6) professor of religion at Baylor University]

No other book has been so chopped, knived, sifted, scrutinized and vilified. What book on philosophy or
religion or psychology or letters of classical or modern times has been subject to such a mass attack as the
Bible? with such venom and skepticism? with such thoroughness and erudition? upon every chapter, line and tenet?

## The Book That Cannot Be Silenced

Despite relentless attempts to burn it, ban it and bury it, the Bible continues to spread. Those who tried to
destroy it have long since passed into history, while the Bible remains translated into over 3500 languages,
accessible to everyone today.

:::tip[The Bible cannot be silenced]

The Bible's survival through fire, exile and censorship shows that it's message is not bound by ink and paper.

**It is living and enduring and it cannot be silenced**

:::

The persecution of the Bible is not just a historical footnote - it is a testament to it's power. Tyrants
and institutions have feared it's message of truth and freedom because it speaks to something deeper than
politics or culture: the human soul's search for meaning, justice and redemption.
