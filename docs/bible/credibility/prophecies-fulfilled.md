# Prophecies Fulfilled

Biblical prophecy is not vague fortune-telling. Unlike vague spiritual sayings or poetic insights, biblical prophecies
are extremely detailed, specific and verifiable. They span centuries, name empires, describe world events and most
remarkably, foretell the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

:::tip[Twice is coincidence, three times a pattern, thousands is ... God! *pure and simple*]

Many people ask if all of this is just coincidence? Or the result of retroactive editing? The evidence very significantly
suggests otherwise.

**The Bible contains over 1,800 predictive prophecies, many of which are demonstrably fulfilled.**

No other religious text or historical document *makes this kind of claim*, ***much less fulfills it.***

:::

**Fulfilled prophecy offers powerful confirmation that the Bible is not just a man made religious narrative, but the
product of divine authorship!**

God Himself appeals to fulfilled prophecy as proof of His identity

:::note[[Isa 46:5,9-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2046&version=NKJV)]

To whom will you liken Me and make Me equal And compare Me, that we should be alike?
...

Remember the former things of old, For I am God and there is no other;

I am God and there is none like Me, Declaring the end from the beginning,

And from ancient times things that are not yet done, Saying, 
"My counsel shall stand and I will do all My pleasure"

## Messianic Prophecies - Jesus in the Old Testament

One of the most compelling arguments for the divine authorship of Scripture is the [greater than 350 Old Testament prophecies
fulfilled in the life of Jesus](../../jesus/crediblilty/prophecies-fulfilled.md#350-prophecies-fulfilled-by-jesus) - several of them
written almost a staggering 40 centuries before His birth!

#### Isaiah 52 and 53 - The Suffering Servant
Isaiah 52:13 through 53:12 is one of the most detailed messianic prophecies. **Written between 740-680 BC**, it describes a servant of
God who suffers not for his own sins, but for the sins of others. Consider the parallels with Jesus:

| # | Old Testament Prophesy | New Testament Fulfillment	|

Even secular scholars acknowledge that this passage reads eerily like a post - crucifixion Christian text; however
[the Dead Sea Scrolls](./acheological-support#the-dead-sea-scrolls), (circa 250 BC) contain
copies of the prophet Isaiah showing **these prophecy predated Jesus by 7 centuries!**

#### Psalm 22 - A Detailed Description of Crucifixion

Written about 1000 years before Jesus, Psalm 22 opens with the line *"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"*.
This is the very Psalm that Jesus quotes from the cross
([Mat 27:46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mat%2027%3A46&version=NKJV)). 
King David wrote this 10 centuries before Jesus was on the earth and it includes incredible details that perfectly
match the crucifixion - bear in mind this form of execution was not even invented at the time of King David. The Babylonians and
Assyrians started it in the 6th century and the Romans practiced in the 5th century onwards! 


| # | Old Testament Prophesy | New Testament Fulfillment	|
|--|---	|---	|
| 1| Forsaken because of sins of others (Psa 22:1) | For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us (2 Cor 5:21) |
| 2| My God, my God, why have You forsaken me? (Psa 22:1) | Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? (Mat 27:46) |
| 3| Day and night at the same time (Psa 22:2)	| Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour there was darkness over all the land (Mat 27:45) |
| 4| All who see me mock me, shake their head and insult me	(Psa 22:7)	| And those who passed by blasphemed Him ...  (Mat 27:39-44) |
| 5| He trusted in God, let Him deliver Him (Psa 22:8)	| Mocking with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross and we will believe...  (Mat 27:43) |
| 6| Born the Savior (Psa 22:9-10) | Jesus is the Saviour of the world (Luke 2:7) |
| 7| They seek His death (Psa 22:12-13)	|The chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, saying, 'Crucify Him, crucify Him!' (John 19:6) |
| 8| His blood poured out when they pierced His side (Psa 22:14) | But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear and immediately blood and water came out	(John 19:34) |
| 9| Suffered extreme agony (Psa 22:14-15) | Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? .....  (Mark 15:34-37) |
| 10| He thirsted (Psa 22:15) | Jesus, knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, 'I thirst!'	(John 19:28) |
| 11| They pierced His hands and His feet (Psa 22:16) |And again another Scripture says, 'They shall look on Him whom they pierced' (John 19:34-37, 20:27) |
| 12| Stripped Him before the stares of men (Psa 22:17-18) | And they divided His garments ... And the people stood looking on. (Luke 23:34-35) |
| 13| They parted His garments (Psa 22:18)	|And they divided His garments ... (John 19:23-24) |
| 14| They cast lots for His garments (Psa 22:18)	| And they divided His garments and cast lots for them. (John 19:23-24) |
| 15| He committed Himself to God (Psa 22:20-21) | Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit. Having said this, He breathed His last. (Luke 23:46) |
| 16| Satanic power bruising the Redeemer's heel	(Psa 22:20-21)	| Through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, (Heb 2:14) |
| 17| His Resurrection declared	(Psa 22:22) | I am ascending to My Father and your Father and to My God and your God. (John 20:17) |
| 18| He shall be the governor of the nations (Psa 22:27-28) | Every knee shall bow (Phil 2:10) |
| 19| It is finished (Psa 22:31)	| He said, 'It is finished!' And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit. (John 19:30, Heb 10:10-12, 14, 18) |

Even the tiny details like dividing his clothes and casting lots for them; that there is darkness for 3 hours during the middle of the day, right to
**Jesus saying "It is Finished!"** - recorded about 1400 years before He was on the earth. 

Without a shadow of a doubt this is the hand of a divine God, not purely coincidence.

## Events in Jesus' Life That Fulfill Old Testament Prophecies

The New Testament gospels repeatedly state that Jesus fulfilled what was written
*"in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms* ([Luke 24:44](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2024%3A44&version=NKJV)).
These are just some highlights from the [full list of over 350 fulfilled prophecies](../../jesus/crediblilty/prophecies-fulfilled.md#350-prophecies-fulfilled-by-jesus)

Again, you are encouraged to do your own research and study the Bible for yourself.

:::tip[Only Jesus, the Messiah Jesus could fulfill these]

The probability of one person fulfilling hundreds of ancient prophecies might seem incredibly low
(especially given many are over 15 centuries before Jesus was on the earth). However, the fact that
Jesus fulfilled more than 350 of them is something truly remarkable and mind blowing. This is evidence
of divine purpose and confirmation that Jesus is the Messiah.

It's a powerful reminder that we are finite beings and extraordinary things happen with a God that is
infinite, that go beyond what we might expect or calculate!

## Daniel's Prophecies and the Rise and Fall of Empires

The book of Daniel, written around 600–530 BC, contains prophetic visions of world empires that align
precisely with post-Daniel history.

#### Daniel 2 - Four Empires

In [Daniel 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=daniel%202&version=NKJV), King Nebuchadnezzar dreams
of a statue made of different metals, representing successive kingdoms. Even the secular atheistic scholars
widely agree that these represent:

1. Babylon (gold head) - circa 609-539 BC
2. Medo-Persia (silver chest) - circa 539-331 BC
3. Greece (bronze thighs) - circa 331-63 BC
4. Rome (iron legs) - circa 63 BC-476 AD

**These empires rose and fell in the exact order prophesied.** 6 centuries of history laid out in the exact order
of the empires that rule the earth! *Thats not coincidence.*

#### Daniel 9 - The 70 Weeks Prophecy and the Timing of the Messiah

Perhaps the most astonishing is [Daniel 9:24–27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%209%3A24%E2%80%9327&version=NKJV),
which gives a time prophecy:
*"From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One (Messiah) comes,
there will be seven 'sevens' and sixty-two 'sevens'... " (v.25)*

Using Jewish prophetic reckoning (a 'week' is 7 years), this gives:

7 + 62 = 69 weeks = 483 years

Starting point: decree to rebuild Jerusalem (~457 BC, [Ezra 7:11–26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra%207%3A11%E2%80%9326&version=NKJV))

483 years later = AD 27, the approximate start of Jesus' public ministry

**Many scholars (e.g., Gleason Archer, Josh McDowell) affirm that this prophecy predicts the arrival of the Messiah to the year.**

Coincidence? With this much of accuracy - is that even possible? 


## Objections - Was This Retroactive Editing?

Some skeptics suggest that Jesus' followers retroactively edited the Old Testament or altered the New Testament
to create the appearance of fulfilled prophecy.

### The Dead Sea Scrolls Prove the Old Testament Was Unchanged

[The Dead Sea Scrolls](./acheological-support#the-dead-sea-scrolls), discovered between 1947-1956 near the Dead Sea in Israel, 
represent one of the most significant archaeological finds of the 20th century. These ancient manuscripts, dating from approximately 250 BC. to 68 AD,
contain fragments from every book of the Hebrew Bible except Esther, offering a glimpse into how Scripture appeared
centuries before Christ and have affirmed the accuracy of many biblical passages. 

:::tip[The Dead Sea scrolls verify the Bible!]

The Isaiah Scrolls proved to be **word-for-word identical** with the standard Hebrew Bible in more than 95% of the text,
confirming the accuracy and reliability of the Masoretic Text. 

:::

[Isaiah 53](#isaiah-52-and-53---the-suffering-servant) and [other messianic passages](#psalm-22---a-detailed-description-of-crucifixion)
appear exactly as they do in modern Bibles. This proves that these prophecies existed centuries before Jesus and were not inserted afterward.

### Not All Fulfilled Prophecies Could Be Faked

One might argue that some prophecies (like riding a donkey) could be staged, **but many were completely outside Jesus' human control**,
such as:

- His birth in Bethlehem
- Being born of a virgin
- The timing of His ministry (Daniel 9)
- Betrayal price (30 pieces of silver)
- Method of execution (crucifixion)
- Gambling over His clothing 
- His burial location 
- The resurrection itself

:::tip[The Divine Hand of God at work]

Even if Jesus tried to deliberately *fulfill* certain prophecies, He could not control this many!

:::

## Objections - Could It All Be Coincidence?

Another objection claims these fulfilled prophecies are just statistical chance. But the math tells a different story -
it is impossible.

In [Science Speaks, Peter Stoner](https://www.amazon.com/Science-Speaks-Peter-W-Stoner/dp/0802476309), outlines the mathematical probability of
one person in the 1st century fulfilling just eight of the most clear and straight forward prophecies:

:::info[Science Speaks, Dr. Peter Stoner, Professor Emeritus of Science at Westmont College]

Now these prophecies were either given by inspiration of God or the prophets just wrote them as they thought they should be. In such a case
the prophets had just one chance in 10<sup>17</sup> of having them come true in any man, but they all came true in Christ! **This means that the
fulfillment of these eight prophecies alone proves that God inspired the writing of these prophecies to such absolute definiteness.**

:::

To visualize it, Stoner says: *"Imagine covering the state of Texas two feet deep in silver dollars. Mark one
of them and mix it thoroughly. Then blindfold someone and have them pick one coin. The chance they'd pick the marked coin
is the same as 1 in 10<sup>17</sup>."*

Dr. Stoner went on to calculate the probability of one person fulfilling 48 prophecies to be 1 in
10<sup>157</sup>. Yet the Bible has more than 350 prophesies that have been fulfilled by Jesus Christ
and some to be fulfilled when He returns. One cannot even begin to fathom the numerical value of
that probability...

:::info[The scale of the number of 1 in 10<sup>157</sup>]

Just so you can grasp the magnanimous scale of the prophecies of the coming Messiah, consider these
facts - the size of that number - there are not even that many electrons in the known universe! And
that number is just for 48 of the 350+ known Messianic prophecies that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled. 

**Merely fulfilling 48 of these isn't something that can be explained by random chance. Rather, this
points to a divine origin**

No man could write that book, we call the Bible. The Bible was written by kings, generals, shepherds,
priests, over 1600 years, in 3 languages, on 3 continents, totally 66 books. It was written mostly by
authors who had never met each other, who wrote about controversial subjects and yet all 66 books
agree.

**You can absolutely stake your life on it's authenticity, authority and trustworthiness. And
you can and should stake your eternal destiny on it also!**

:::

While critics have debated Stoner's assumptions, even conservative estimates show that the probability
of chance fulfillment is effectively zero.

**There is no possible way mathematically this is coincidence.**

## What Scholars Say

**Dr. Francis Collins**, led the [Human Genome Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project) and was the
Director of the National Institute of Health from 2009 to 2021, serving under three presidents. He affirmed
the rationality of Christianity and moved from atheism to belief in part due to its intellectual coherence
and the evidence of prophecy that was fulfilled.

:::tip[Dr. Francis Collins — Former Atheist, Renowned Scientist, Led Human Genome Project]

*"I found the evidence for belief in the God of the Bible to be intellectually compelling...
including the fulfillment of prophecies about Christ."*

— Francis Collins, The Language of God

:::

**Sir Lionel Alfred Luckhoo**, KCMG CBE QC (1914 – 1997) was a Guyanese politician, diplomat and lawyer,
famed for his 245 consecutive successful defences in murder cases. Luckhoo was deeply skeptical and
relied on evidence, more so given his law background. Prophecy was a key part of his conversion.

:::tip[Sir Lionel Luckhoo — World's Most Successful Trial Lawyer, Former Skeptic turned Christian]

*"I have spent more than 42 years as a defense trial lawyer appearing in many parts of the world... 
I say unequivocally the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus Christ is so overwhelming that it
compels acceptance by proof which leaves absolutely no room for doubt."*

— Sir Lionel Luckhoo

:::

**Josh McDowell** began his research as a hostile skeptic and set out to disprove Christianity. He was
overwhelmed by the predictive power of messianic prophecies like Isaiah 53 and Psalm 22.

:::tip[Josh McDowell — Once an Atheist Investigating Christianity to Refute It]

*"I had to admit that the Old Testament, written hundreds of years before Christ, was being
fulfilled down to the smallest detail in Jesus' life."*

— Josh McDowell, from More Than a Carpenter

*"No other religion or book dares to rest its claims on predictive prophecy. The Bible stands alone, verified by history and reason."*

— Josh McDowell, from Evidence that Demands a Verdict
:::

**Lee Strobel**, was an outspoken atheist who converted after investigating the historical and prophetic
evidence for Jesus. 

:::tip[Lee Strobel, a Former Atheist Journalist and Legal Editor for the Chicago Tribune.]
*"It would have been impossible for Jesus to arrange the fulfillment of all the hundreds of Old Testament
prophecies - many of which He had no control over... unless, of course, He really was the Messiah."*

— Lee Strobel, The Case for Christ
:::

**Craig Evans**, New Testament historian says *"There is no serious scholarly doubt that Jesus was
crucified under Pontius Pilate. What is extraordinary is how closely the details of His death
align with prophecies written centuries earlier."*


**Gleason Archer**, a biblical scholar says *"The Holy Scriptures are demonstrated to be a divine revelation
by the fulfillment of specific predictions made hundreds of years in advance, which no mere human wisdom
could have anticipated."*

Many former atheists - including legal experts, scientists and journalists have investigated the prophecies
of the Bible not to believe, but to disprove the Bible and Jesus Christ. Yet instead of finding fiction, they
discovered a pattern of fulfillment so specific, so improbable and so historically grounded that it led them
to faith in Christ. As Lee Strobel put it *"Only God could pull this off."*


## Why Fulfilled Prophecy Matters

Biblical prophecy is not simply about prediction - it's about proving the divine origin of Scripture.
As one scholar put it:

:::tip[Norman Geisler]

Fulfilled prophecy is the fingerprint of God on the pages of history

:::

Fulfilled prophecy shows that God is sovereign over history ([Isa 46:5,9–10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2046%3A5-10&version=NKJV)).
It proves without a shadow of a doubt that the Bible is not a random compilation of thoughts,
it's accurate down to the details! 

**Jesus is the promised Messiah, not a myth or exaggeration.**

**The Christian faith is grounded in real events, not wishful thinking.**


## Conclusion - Only God Could Do This

The sheer volume, specificity and fulfillment of biblical prophecy are unlike anything in ancient literature.
It's not just that the Bible claims to predict the future - it goes ahead and demonstrably does so, in ways that
no human author or conspiracy could accomplish.

The prophecies of Daniel chart the course of history 6 centuries before it happened and gave details to the empires
that would follow and in the exact order that they would come. Numerous former atheists - including professionals in
law, science and journalism - approached biblical prophecy with the goal of discrediting it, not embracing it.
However, rather than uncovering myth or fabrication, they encountered a sequence of fulfilled predictions so precise,
improbable and historically verifiable that it ultimately convinced them of the truth of Christianity.
As Lee Strobel famously said, *"Only God could pull this off."*

The messianic predictions of Isaiah, Psalms, Micah and Zechariah align precisely with events in the life of Jesus.

Ancient texts like the Dead Sea Scrolls confirm these prophecies existed long before Jesus.

Mathematical probability shows that these fulfillments could not have happened by chance.

**If these things are true - and the evidence says they are - then the Bible is more than a human book - it is a divine revelation!**

**And Jesus is more than a good teacher. He is the Messiah foretold by the prophets - the One who came, not by chance or manipulation, but by the will and design of God.**
