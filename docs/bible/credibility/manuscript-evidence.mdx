# Manuscript Evidence

The Bible is the most read, translated and scrutinized book in human history. But is it reliable?
Can we trust that the Bible we read today accurately reflects the original writings penned thousands of years ago?

To answer this question, scholars turn to manuscript evidence - the handwritten copies of the
original texts. Manuscript quantity, quality, dating and consistency are all essential factors in
determining a text's reliability. In the case of the Bible, particularly the New Testament, the manuscript
evidence is unparalleled among ancient documents.

## Manuscript Numbers

A foundational principle in textual criticism is simple: the more manuscripts we have and the closer
they are to the original writing, the better we can reconstruct the original text.

Manuscript Comparison from [Evidence That Demands a Verdict, Josh McDowell & Sean McDowell (2017)](https://www.amazon.com.au/Evidence-That-Demands-Verdict-Life-changing/dp/1401676707)
| Ancient Work	| Earliest Copy	 | Time Gap	| Number of Copies |
|---	|---	|---	|---	| 
| Homer's Iliad	 |500 BC |	~400 years	| 1757 |
| Caesar's Gallic Wars	| 900 AD |	~1,000 years |	~10 |
| Plato	| 900 AD |	~1,200 years |	~7 |
| Tacitus (Annals)	| 1100 AD |	~1,000 years |	~20 |
| New Testament	| 125 AD (fragment) |	~30–60 years  |	5,800+ Greek, **25,000+ total** |

No other ancient work comes close to the volume of New Testament manuscripts or their proximity to
the original events. Over 5800 Greek manuscripts, plus thousands more in Latin, Syriac, Coptic and
other languages, provide an overwhelming body of evidence for textual comparison.

:::tip[The Bible the most historically attested document in antiquity]

No other ancient text has so many early, independent copies. The sheer volume and closeness of
these manuscripts to the originals make the Bible the most historically attested document in antiquity.

## Manuscript Dating 

The New Testament was written between approximately 45-95 AD. The earliest known manuscript fragment,
P52 (Rylands Library Papyrus), is dated to around 125 AD and contains part of the Gospel of John -
placing it within just 30–40 years of the original composition.

Early Manuscripts of the New Testament include:

- P52 (John fragment) – c. AD 125
- Codex Vaticanus – c. AD 325–350
- Codex Sinaiticus – c. AD 330–360, contains nearly the entire Bible
- P66 and P75 – c. AD 175–225, preserve large portions of the Gospels

This early dating is crucial. The closer a manuscript is to the original, the less time there
is for textual corruption or legendary development. By comparison, most classical works have
time gaps of 500-1000 years between their original composition and the earliest surviving copy.

## The Dead Sea Scrolls

The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered between 1947-1956 near the Dead Sea in Israel, represent one of the most significant
archaeological finds of the 20th century. These ancient manuscripts, dating from approximately 250 BC. to 68 AD,
contain fragments from every book of the Hebrew Bible except Esther, offering a glimpse into how Scripture appeared
centuries before Christ and have affirmed the accuracy of many biblical passages.

The scrolls were found in 11 caves near Qumran, a site associated with the Essenes, a Jewish sect that lived during
the Second Temple period which ended circa 70 AD. Prior to the Dead Sea Scrolls, the earliest complete Hebrew manuscripts
of the Old Testament were from the medieval period, such as the Leningrad Codex dated to 1008 AD. The Isaiah Scrolls
found in Qumran Cave 1, dating to the 1st century BC, were a thousand years older than the Leningrad Codex and verified
the current day text showing it to be word for word accurate, a little over 2000 years later!

:::tip[The Dead Sea scrolls verify the Bible!]

The Isaiah Scrolls proved to be **word-for-word identical** with the standard Hebrew Bible in more than 95% of the text,
confirming the accuracy and reliability of the Masoretic Text. 

:::

The Dead Sea Scrolls have revolutionized the study of the Hebrew Bible. Their discovery pushed back the history of the
Hebrew text by a thousand years, providing scholars with manuscripts from the 2nd century BC. and earlier.
**This discovery has shed light on the meanings of many individual Hebrew words, clarified obscure passages and
confirmed the overall reliability of the Hebrew text.**

While the Dead Sea Scrolls primarily contain Jewish texts, they provide valuable context for understanding the environment
in which early Christianity emerged. The scrolls offer insights into Jewish beliefs and practices during the Second Temple
period, shedding light on the religious landscape into which Jesus and the apostles were born.


## Timeline of Key Manuscripts

<TimelineComponent source={require('/json/tjs-bible-manuscripts.json')} scale_factor={2} initial_zoom={1}/>

## Codices

#### Sinaiticus - c. 350 AD

One of the most important biblical manuscripts ever discovered is the Codex Sinaiticus,
dated to the mid 4th century AD. It is a complete copy of the New Testament, along with much of the
Old Testament in Greek (the Septuagint).

Discovered at St. Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, Codex Sinaiticus demonstrates how
early the full New Testament was being copied and circulated. The consistency of the New Testament
text even by the 4th century was exceptional. The professional care with which scribes preserved
the Scriptures is first rate.

#### Vaticanus  - c. 350 AD

Housed in the Vatican Library, Codex Vaticanus is one of the oldest nearly complete Greek Bibles.
Dating to the 300s AD, it preserves much of the Septuagint and New Testament with remarkable accuracy.
It's a priceless window into the early transmission of Scripture. 

Together with the Codex Sinaiticus, it provides a powerful witness
to the stability of the biblical text long before the printing press or modern textual scholarship.

#### Chester Beatty Papyri - c. 3rd century AD

Chester Beatty Papyri is another collection of early Christian manuscripts dating from the 2nd - 4th
centuries, containing portions of the Old and New Testaments.

#### Alexandrinus  - c. 450 AD

The Codex Alexandrinus is a 5th century manuscript of the Greek Bible, containing the majority
of the Old and New Testaments.

#### Leningrad - 1000 AD

The Codex Leningrad is the oldest complete manuscript of the Hebrew Bible still in existence.
Meticulously copied by Masoretic scribes, it preserves the Hebrew text with extraordinary care.
It remains a foundational reference for modern Old Testament translations. It is an enduring
testament to the precision and preservation of Scripture through the ages.


## The Unified Bible

#### Wycliffe Bible - 1380s AD

John Wycliffe believed everyone should access God's Word in their own tongue. His
followers translated the Bible from Latin into English - by hand and against opposition.
Though banned and burned, the Wycliffe Bible lit a flame for reform and literacy.
A bold step toward the Reformation, centuries before it began - it sparked controversy
with the Church and laid the groundwork for future reform.

#### Gutenberg Bible - c. 1455 AD

The Gutenberg Bible was the first book ever printed with movable type - a technological and spiritual breakthrough.
Printed in Latin, it marked the dawn of the printed word and mass communication.
It made the Bible more accessible and paved the way for the Reformation.

#### Luther Bible - 1522–1534 AD

Martin Luther sparked a revolution when he nailed 95 theses to a church door in 1517 AD.
He challenged corruption and proclaimed that salvation comes by faith alone.
Luther's German Bible put Scripture into the hands of everyday people.
His bold stand lit the fire of the Protestant Reformation and changed history forever.


#### Tyndale Bible - 1525–1536 AD

William Tyndale risked his life to translate the Bible from Hebrew and Greek into English and
was the first of its kind. His work brought the Scriptures to common people for the first time -
clear, bold and forbidden.

Tyndale was executed, but his words lived on - nearly 90% of the King James Bible echoes his phrasing.
He gave his life so others could read God's Word.

#### Geneva Bible - 1560 AD

Birthed by English reformers in exile, the Geneva Bible was the first to include study notes and numbered verses.
Beloved by Puritans and carried to the New World, it shaped minds and nations. It's language was sharp,
it's theology bold used by Shakespeare and quoted by revolutionaries.


#### King James Bible - 1611 AD

Commissioned by King James I of England, over 50 scholars united to translate the Bible into
majestic English. Published in 1611 AD, based on the earlier work of William Tyndale, it became
one of the most influential books in history. It's poetic language shaped both faith and the
English-speaking world for centuries. Truly a monumental work rooted in reverence, precision and legacy


**These manuscripts, along with the Dead Sea Scrolls, provide a wealth of evidence supporting
the transmission and preservation of biblical texts over millennia.**


## Textual Consistency and the Myth of Errors

Critics often claim that the Bible is full of contradictions or copyist errors. It's true that no
two manuscripts are identical - but that's expected in any hand-copied tradition. The field of
textual criticism exists precisely to evaluate and resolve these variations.

How Significant Are the Variants?
Bruce Metzger, one of the foremost New Testament scholars says, *"The textual
variations in the New Testament manuscripts are relatively insignificant in terms of the
substance of Christian doctrine."* Even Dr. Bart Ehrman, a non Christian and a New Testament scholar
and well known critic of the textual scholarship of the New Testament says that he agrees with Dr. Metzger,
in his book *Misquoting Jesus*.

:::info[[Misquoting Jesus](https://www.amazon.com/Misquoting-Jesus-Story-Behind-Changed/dp/0060859512), Dr. Bart Ehrman, pg 252]

If he and I were put in a room and asked to hammer out a consensus statement on what we think the original text of the
New Testament looked like, there would be very few points of disagreement ... **The position I argue for in Misquoting
Jesus does not actually stand at odds with Prof. Metzger's position that the essential Christian beliefs are not affected
by textual variants in the manuscript tradition of the New Testament.**

:::

Estimates suggest there are around 400000 textual variants across all known manuscripts,
but these occur within millions of lines of text. Most variants fall into categories such as:
- Spelling differences
- Word order changes (e.g., "Christ Jesus" vs. "Jesus Christ")
- Repetitions or skipped lines (scribal errors)
- Only a small fraction (perhaps 1%) are considered meaningful and none affect essential
Christian beliefs such as the deity of Christ, the resurrection, or salvation by grace.

## Addressing Alleged Contradictions

Many alleged contradictions in the Bible fall into the category of apparent discrepancies,
which can often be resolved by understanding the literary, cultural, or historical context.

Examples:
Two angels or one? [Mat 28:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2028%3A2&version=NKJV)
mentions one angel at Jesus' tomb; [John 20:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2020%3A12%5D&version=NKJV)
mentions two. There's no contradiction though - Matthew just focuses on the one who spoke.

Genealogies of Jesus ([Mat 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%201&version=NKJV) vs.
[Luke 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%203&version=NKJV)): These differ because Matthew traces Joseph's
legal line (through Solomon), while Luke traces Mary's biological line (through Nathan, Solomon's brother)

Different accounts of Judas' death: [Mat 27:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt%2027%3A5&version=NKJV)
and [Acts 1:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%201%3A18&version=NKJV) describe the same event from
different perspectives - one focusing on the hanging, the other on the gruesome result.

In *The Text of the New Testament, Bruce Metzger* emphasizes that even where textual variants
exist, the vast manuscript tradition allows us to identify the original wording with
extremely high confidence.

## Why Manuscript Evidence Matters

#### Proximity to the Events
The New Testament was written within living memory of the events it describes. Many letters
and gospels were circulating while eyewitnesses were still alive - meaning fabrications
could be challenged.

As historian A.N. Sherwin-White (Oxford) noted: *"For Acts the confirmation of historicity
is overwhelming... any attempt to reject its basic historicity must now appear absurd."*

#### Transparency of Transmission
Unlike other ancient texts, every stage of the Bible's textual development is open to
scholarly review. We have access to early manuscripts, variant readings and detailed textual
notes in modern editions.

This transparency allows modern translations to include footnotes and alternate readings,
giving readers confidence that nothing is hidden or manipulated.

## What About the Apocryphal or 'Lost' Gospels?

Occasionally, media reports highlight so-called *"lost gospels"* like the Gospel of
Thomas, Judas, or Mary. These texts were written well after the New Testament era, often
in the 2nd or 3rd centuries and reflect Gnostic teachings that differ sharply from 
the theology and historical grounding of the canonical gospels. Josephus, a
1st century Jewish Roman historian, explicitly excluded it from his count of sacred books and
never referenced it as Scripture. Neither Jesus nor the New Testament writers quoted from the
Apocrypha, despite referencing nearly every book of the Hebrew canon.

By contrast, the four canonical gospels:
- Were written within decades of Jesus' death
- Have early manuscript support
- Are quoted extensively by early Church Fathers (e.g., Ignatius, Polycarp, Irenaeus)

The manuscript evidence for the New Testament canon is vastly superior to that of the
Gnostic texts in both age and number.

## The Verdict of Modern Scholarship

Bruce Metzger (Princeton Theological Seminary) says *"The amount of evidence for the text
of the New Testament, whether derived from manuscripts, early translations, or quotations
in the Church Fathers, is so much greater than that for any other ancient literature
that the student... is simply overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of material."*

:::info[[Josh McDowell, in Evidence That Demands a Verdict](https://www.amazon.com.au/Evidence-That-Demands-Verdict-Life-changing/dp/1401676707)]

The New Testament has more manuscripts, earlier dating and more eyewitness corroboration
than any other document of antiquity

:::

The manuscript evidence for the Bible - especially the New Testament - is unlike that of
any other book from the ancient world. With:
- Over 25,000 total manuscripts in multiple languages
- Copies dating within decades of the originals
- A transparent, consistent and reliable transmission process
- Substantial [archaeological](./acheological-support.mdx) and [historical support](./historical-accuracy.md)


:::tip[The Bible stands alone]
No ancient text has been preserved with such care, copied with such consistency or verified with such scholarly rigor.

**If we accept the authenticity of works by Homer, Caesar, or Plato which do not have anywhere close to this level of scrutiny and care;
then we have every reason - and then some - to trust the Bible!**

## A Text We Can Trust

The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls has had a profound impact on biblical scholarship,
confirming the accuracy and reliability of the Old Testament texts. Together with other
ancient manuscripts, they provide compelling evidence for the legitimacy of the Bible as
a faithfully transmitted and preserved document.
