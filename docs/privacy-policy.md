# Privacy Policy

## Introduction
We value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and protect your personal information when you visit our website.

By accessing or using our website, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect
We do not collect any personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provide it (such as through a contact form etc.). The information we may collect includes:

- **Usage Data**: We collect information about how you interact with our website, such as which pages you visit, how long you stay on pages and what links you click. This data is **anonymous** and cannot be used to personally identify you.

## How We Use Your Data
We use the information we collect to:
- Improve the user experience on our website.
- Track website traffic and analyze usage patterns to enhance content and features.
- Monitor the performance of our website and troubleshoot technical issues.

## Google Analytics
We use **Google Analytics** to gather anonymous information about how visitors use our website. Google Analytics collects data on page visits, user engagement and other non-personally identifiable interactions. 

- **Important Note**: We do not collect IP addresses or any other personally identifiable information through Google Analytics.
- **IP Anonymization**: Google Analytics anonymizes the data it collects by masking the last portion of users' IP addresses before storing or processing them. This ensures that no personally identifiable information is stored or used for tracking purposes.

## Data Retention
We retain anonymous usage data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy or as required by law. We do not store any personally identifiable information unless explicitly provided by the user.

## Your Rights
You have the right to:
- **Access**: Request information about the data we collect.
- **Rectification**: Request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Erasure**: Request the deletion of any data we hold about you (though we do not collect personally identifiable information unless voluntarily provided).
- **Opt-out of Tracking**: You may opt-out of data collection by Google Analytics using the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Third-Party Services
We may use third-party services (like Google Analytics) to help us analyze website usage. These third parties may collect anonymous data about your use of our website, but they will not collect any personally identifiable information unless you explicitly provide it to them.

- Google Analytics: [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Cookies
Please refer to our [Cookie Policy](./cookie-policy.md)

## Data Security
We take reasonable precautions to protect your data. However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated policy on this page and update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.
